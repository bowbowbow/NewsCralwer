Suppliers in the United States, the world’s biggest natural gas producer, have had a difficult time in recent years getting shipments to some regions, including fuel-hungry New England, as environmental lawsuits by states, green groups and property owners have tied up pipeline construction. The administration of President Donald Trump has said that constraints on pipelines and other energy infrastructure can trigger price spikes and pose a risk to national security but has yet to intervene in state or local-level permitting issues.  “It’s definitely not getting easier to build a new pipeline,” Stanley Chapman, executive vice president and president of U.S. natural gas pipelines at TransCanada Corp, told Reuters on the sidelines at the World Gas Conference in Washington. “I’m seeing more already-approved pipeline projects that are under construction get held up by a judge in lawsuits and this has to be addressed either by FERC or with legislation,” he said. FERC, or the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, oversees construction of new pipelines. TransCanada owns about 30,000 miles (48,280 kilometers) of gas pipeline in the United States, making it one of the country’s biggest operators. It has been trying for more than a decade to build its Keystone XL oil pipeline project linking Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries. Other pipeline developers feel the same. “Fifteen years ago nobody cared that much about pipelines, today pipelines are under siege,” said Al Monaco, president and CEO of Enbridge Inc, with over 27,000 miles of gas transmission lines in North America. FERC in April asked stakeholders to submit comments on whether the commission should revise existing pipeline approval policies, yielding feedback from industry backers. “I have encouraged the FERC commissioners that if they move forward in revising this (policy) they should focus on timely review and approval or disapproval of pipeline certificates,” U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said at the World Gas Conference. She said it was tough for firms to invest in new pipelines when “every regulatory action yields a lawsuit” that “leaves no project safe from the retroactive pulling of permits.”     STOPPING PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION In recent weeks, environmental groups like the Sierra Club have won court orders delaying construction on EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley pipeline at several locations in West Virginia, and are now seeking a court order to also stop construction in Virginia. “We don’t need these pipelines to meet our energy needs, so it makes no sense to lock us into generations of dependence on dirty fossil fuels,” said Joan Walker, who helps lead the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign. EQT said it was disappointed and was evaluating legal and regulatory options to continue construction. “If you stop the pipelines, you stop energy development. That’s how the thinking goes,” Enbridge’s Monaco said about the efforts of environmental groups. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines under construction to move gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to consumers in the Southeast, Gulf Coast and Midwest. Production in the Marcellus and Utica, the biggest shale gas formations in the United States, has ballooned to 28.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) from 1.5 bcfd a decade ago, according to federal energy data. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.  The industry is now eyeing growing export markets by investing in facilities that can liquefy gas for shipment overseas. The United States has sent cargoes to nearly 30 countries in the past year. NEW YORK BLOCKS GAS PIPES Senator Capito said it was ironic that U.S. gas is headed around the world but struggles to reach New England. “Right now gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale is being blocked by some of our neighboring states, which cuts off our markets in New England,” she said, referring to New York which spans the Canadian border to the Atlantic. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said New York’s efforts to stop new pipelines could pose “a national security issue that outweighs the political concerns in Albany, New York.” He said polar vortex weather in the winter or a cyber attack could threaten to leave Wall Street in the dark and hospitals without power. “The leadership (of New York) is keeping pipelines from being built for strictly political purposes,” Perry said. In January, gas prices soared to a record high due to pipeline constraints during an extreme cold spell that forced power generators in New England to resort to burning diesel and Russian imported LNG. New York has denied water permits for a few pipelines from Pennsylvania, including Williams Cos Inc’s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement projects and National Fuel Gas Co’s Northern Access. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said the department has a rigorous review process to protect public health and the environment.

The money, Vale said, will come from a separate provision made by the company in the second quarter of 2016. Brazil’s worst environmental catastrophe ocurred when a dam designed to hold back mine waste burst in November, 2015, killing 19 people and leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers. Samarco’s operations have been halted ever since.

Still looming over Samarco and its parents is a separate lawsuit, work 155 billion reais. BHP said on Monday that the settlement set a two-year timeline to reach a settlement over that case.

Players like Marcos Rojo, whose dramatic 86th minute volley against Nigeria kept Argentina’s hopes alive, have scored many more vital late goals in the group matches than at the same stage of the previous two World Cups. The thrilling finales have included the one that saw the shock exit of champions Germany on Wednesday. As the first stage of the World Cup closed on Thursday, figures show how consequential much of the late action has been. In the group matches, 26 goals were scored after the 80th minute, of which 13 — or 50 percent — have been winners or equalisers, according to an analysis by Reuters of data provided by sports data firm Opta. The total does not include other late goals which added to the drama of games but did not change their outcome, such as the second of Brazil’s stoppage time goals against Costa Rica or South Korea’s second goal against Germany in the dying seconds. By comparison, during the group stage of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, 26 goals were also scored after the 80th minute but only eight — or 31 percent — were decisive. In 2010, in South Africa, five of 20 similarly late goals — or 25 percent — settled group stage matches. “There are so many late goals being scored that you need some luck as well,” Germany’s Marco Reus said after his team’s win over Sweden in Group F on June 23, which was clinched by a Toni Kroos strike just seconds before the final whistle. While Germany were stunningly knocked out a few days later, after the nerve-wrecking climax of their game against modest South Korea, the late goal drama has mostly favoured the bigger teams competing in Russia. Harry Kane scored in injury time to secure England’s 2-1 over Tunisia in their first match of the tournament while Uruguay left it late to beat Egypt with an 89th-minute goal from Jose Gimenez. But the underdogs have had their fun too. Iran slotted home a penalty in the 93rd minute of their match against Portugal which ended 1-1 and Morocco went ahead against Spain in the 81st minute, only for the Spaniards to level in stoppage time. The profusion of so many late and important goals in Russia seems to be connected with the introduction of the Video Assistant Referee system. Alex Olshansky, an independent soccer analyst based in New York, said matches were tending to run a bit longer because of the use of VAR during games, adding to the amount of stoppage time being played and increasing the chances of late goals. “Defenders also get tired,” he said. “It’s easy for us to watch on our couches and not realise that these guys have just run six miles over the last two hours. Sometimes, teams lose their shape towards the very end.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-goals/soccer-leaving-it-late-last-gasp-goals-light-up-world-cup-idUKL1N1TU1UR","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f57c"},{"title":"World shares inch up on Wall Street; trade worries boost safety assets","description":"A gauge of global stocks eked out a gain as Wall Street closed higher on rises in financial and technology shares on Thursday, but U.S.-driven trade tensions continued to weigh on sentiment and boosted safety buying of Treasuries and German Bunds.","author":"Laila Kearney","pubDate":"2018-06-28T22:53:57+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"UK,GLOBAL,MARKETS,Germany,Japan,Western Europe,Crude Oil,Credit and Corporate Debt,Currencies / Foreign Exchange Markets,Interest Rates / Policy,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Equities Markets,Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Department Stores (TRBC),Economic News (3rd Party),United States,Company News,Gold,Financials (Legacy),Market Reports,China (PRC),European Union,National Government Debt,Internet / World Wide Web,Europe,Commodities News (3rd Party),Reports,Emerging Market Countries","contentText":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks eked out a gain as Wall Street closed higher on rises in financial and technology shares on Thursday, but U.S.-driven trade tensions continued to weigh on sentiment and boosted safety buying of Treasuries and German Bunds.  Wall Street technology shares rose a day after slumping on the U.S.-China trade dispute and financial stocks found favour after a 13-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.46 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,216.05, the S&P 500 gained 16.68 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,716.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.60 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,503.68.  The S&P 500 earlier in the day seesawed between gains and losses, stung by a drop in the S&P health sector after Amazon.com Inc announced the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack, sparking a selloff in shares of drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers.  An escalating trade fight between the United States and major partners, including China, the European Union and Canada, also continued to exert pressure.  “There’s been inconsistency out of the White House as to what the (trade) policy actually is,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “We’re all just waiting and tapping our foot to see the actual policy.” European shares and Chinese shares reacted to plans outlined late on Wednesday by U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to clamp down on Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies.  After clawing back some ground on Wednesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 and Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX were down 0.8 and 1.4 percent respectively, with technology and carmakers taking the biggest hits. Asian shares dropped to a nine-month trough and MSCI’s emerging market index - which includes other hard-hit countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - was at its weakest in almost a year. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.08 pct. U.S. Treasury and German Bund yields remained near one-month lows as investors moved into bonds for the guaranteed returns stocks cannot offer. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes traded just above the low of 32 basis points reached on Wednesday, which was the flattest since 2007.     A battle over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government additionally boosted demand for safe-haven debt, raising concerns that the euro zone’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose against the safer Japanese yen in the absence of trade-related rhetoric for the day. The dollar was up 0.26 percent against the yen, at 110.54 yen. Gold fell to its lowest level in more than six months on mounting pressure from trade disputes, the expectation of higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar. A strong greenback makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non U.S. investors and while falling equities, seen as risky assets, usually help safe-haven gold, they have failed to do so this time. Oil prices climbed, with U.S. crude hitting a 3-1/2-year high, bolstered by supply concerns due to U.S. sanctions that could cause a large drop in crude exports from Iran. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 69 cents, nearly 1 percent, to settle at $73.45 a barrel. It reached $74.03 earlier in the session, the highest since Nov. 26, 2014. Brent crude futures rose 23 cents to settle at $77.85 a barrel.

The $43 billion development, one of the most expensive U.S.-based LNG projects, is being reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, with a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) expected in March 2019, followed by a final EIS in December 2019. If approved, the 20 million tonne per annum (Mtpa) export project could be operating as soon as the end of 2024, Richards told Reuters at the triennial gathering of global gas players. Owned entirely by the cash-poor state of Alaska, the project has signed preliminary deals with a number of Chinese players, including a development pledge with Sinopec, China Investment Corp and the Bank of China that could amount to up to 75 percent of its offtake. The Alaska LNG development includes an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline from the North Slope to south central Alaska, where gas will be distributed for in-state use and to a liquefaction plant to produce LNG for export. Most of the gas from Alaska LNG is expected to go to China, with Sinopec also helping with the marketing, although AGDC also has preliminary deals with other firms. AGDC, which hopes to revive Alaska’s dwindling energy sector, is working with Goldman Sachs and the Bank of China to put together the equity package. (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Washington, D.C.

Investors’ lack of risk-taking was also displayed in the credit markets. U.S.-based high-yield bonds, which move in sympathy with equities, posted $1.1 billion of cash withdrawals in the week ended June 27, in a second consecutive week of outflows, Lipper said.  U.S.-based equity mutual funds posted $8 billion of outflows in the week and U.S.-based equity exchange-traded funds posted $12 billion of cash withdrawals for the same period.   Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters Lipper, said equity funds suffered their second-largest weekly net outflow of the year, fourth straight weekly outflow, and the sixth largest since Lipper began tracking the data in 1992. “I think this is a function of the uncertainty we see in the markets caused by the trade tensions/potential trade war,” Keon said. The lion’s share of the outflows from equity funds for this week of over $12 billion and the last four of more than $24.5 billion have come from equity exchange-traded funds, “which are typically more responsive to current market events than mutual funds,” Keon said.     Investors sought shelter in higher-quality bond funds, including money market, Treasury and investment-grade corporate bond funds. U.S.-based money market funds attracted more than $18 billion of new cash for the week, following two weeks of withdrawals, Lipper said.  U.S.-based government-Treasury bond funds attracted $781 million, their fourth consecutive week of inflows, according to Lipper data. U.S.-based corporate investment-grade bond funds attract $1.5 billion of new cash for week, extending weekly inflow streak since February, Lipper said. Outside of the United States,  U.S.-based international equity funds posted $6 billion of cash withdrawals for the week, their fifth consecutive week of outflows, according to Lipper.

Taking Derna, a city of 125,000 about 265 km (165 miles) west of Libya’s border with Egypt, marks an important step for Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) as it tries to consolidate its power. Based in eastern Libya, the LNA is one of the main factions that have vied for power since the 2011 Nato-backed uprising that ended more than four decades of rule by Muammar Gaddafi.  It was not possible to independently verify the extent of LNA control in central Derna, where the LNA’s rivals had been holding out. The victory announcement followed clashes in the city on Thursday and heavy airstrikes against the LNA’s opponents, military sources said.   “Thanks be to God, the armed forces control the entire city of Derna,” said a statement posted on the LNA’s Facebook page.  Haftar, who presents himself as the scourge of Islamist extremists, congratulated his supporters for what he said was a victory against “terrorists” in a televised speech. “Today, the banner of terrorism is lowered by your victories, to be replaced by the banner of peace and tranquility despite the terrorists and those who support them,” said the 75-year-old commander, dressed in a khaki military uniform and standing at a podium next to a large Libyan flag. LNA brigades launched a ground offensive in Derna last month after encircling and largely blockading the city over the past two years. Seizing Derna completes the takeover of Libya’s east by Haftar, who built up the LNA during three-year campaign for Benghazi, Libya’s second city. But the Derna fighting could also undercut U.N.-led efforts to stabilise Libya by reconciling eastern-based factions aligned with Haftar and rival groups located in the country’s more populous west. Haftar’s victory announcement came days after the LNA moved to take control oil exports and revenues from eastern ports following fighting in two terminals.   In Derna, the United Nations has warned of the devastating impact of the LNA encirclement and recent fighting on residents. It also expressed alarm earlier this month at allegations of serious human rights abuses including pillage, destruction of property, arbitrary detention and a video of summary executions. After Haftar declared victory in Benghazi in July last year, fighting continued for several months in parts of the city. In Derna, the LNA’s progress has been much faster, aided by what their opponents said were precision air strikes carried out by drones. Neighbouring Egypt, one of several foreign powers that has provided support for Haftar, has in the past carried out air strikes in Derna against what it described as training camps sending militants into Egypt to carry out attacks. Derna, known for its mixed social make-up and as a centre of opposition to the Gaddafi regime, was the first Libyan city in which Islamic State established a foothold in 2014.  It was expelled the following year by a coalition of local fighters and Islamists known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC). They later changed their name to the Derna Protection Force (DPF).

Under the proposal, large companies, such as those with data on more than 50,000 people, would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties. Companies must provide equal service to consumers who exercise such rights under the law. Each violation would carry a $7,500 fine. The law applies to users in California. “This is a huge step forward for California,” State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat, said during a livestreamed press conference Thursday. “This is a huge step forward for people across the country.” Brown signed the measure hours after it unanimously passed the two houses of the legislature as part of an effort to stop a similar measure from reaching the state’s November election ballot.

The loss was the first in over a year for England, ending a 12-match unbeaten run, and set up a last 16 tie with a dangerous Colombia side while Group G winners Belgium face Japan. Beyond that the path England are on seems less perilous with a potential quarter-final against Sweden or Switzerland, while Belgium would face Brazil or Mexico with heavyweights Portugal, Uruguay, France and Argentina also on their side of the draw. Southgate’s lineup, including nine reserves, said more about the importance he placed on the Belgium game than anything he could say but he maintained his decisions had more to do with keeping first-choice players fresh than picking an opponent. “Whatever happens next week (in the knockout rounds) that was the right decision as far as I’m concerned,” he said. “People will say that will only be the right decision if we win but it was the right decision because we could potentially be going into another match that could go into extra time and risking players we didn’t need to risk. “Which half of the draw - who knows what’s right and wrong.” UNDER ATTACK At a World Cup where everything had pretty much gone to plan for England and had seen Southgate lavished with praise, the coach found himself for the first time in Russia under attack for not going all out to claim top spot and a date with Japan. Southgate rolled out all the right cliches and offered his own spin on the gameplan but also stood up to face the music, saying he was ready to accept any criticism. “Sometimes I think you have to look bigger picture and make decisions that might in some cases be criticised but everyone understands in the dressing room what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We don’t like losing, we don’t like to lose matches, but the primary objectives for me we got and I understand that and I think the supporters in the stadium understood that as well.  “Everyone understands the knockout round is the important event.” While Group H winners Colombia are seen as tricky opponents, Southgate said he had  no preference about who his team would line up against in the last 16. “I believe it is a game we can win but it is going to be a fantastic challenge for us,” he said. “Some outstanding individual players but we feel we are a team that is improving. I think we showed tonight that we still have levels to reach. “We know where we are, how immaculate we have to be to win matches against the very best teams.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-eng-bel/soccer-no-agony-of-defeat-as-england-move-on-at-world-cup-idUKL8N1TU79K","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f585"},{"title":"Senate passes farm bill without big food stamp changes","description":"The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping farm bill without the food stamps changes approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month.","author":"Amanda Becker","pubDate":"2018-06-28T22:31:21+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"US,USA,CONGRESS,FARMBILL,Agricultural Markets,Lawmaking,Subsidies,Government Finances,Government / Politics,US House of Representatives,Fishing and Farming (TRBC),Grains,US Government News,Commodities News (3rd Party),US Senate,United States","contentText":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping farm bill without the food stamps changes approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month.

Cornelius Peterson, 29, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston, who said the former financial adviser deserved a significant prison term for misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars from two clients’ accounts. “You were someone who didn’t need the money,” Gorton said. “Well, today you find that fraud and financial crimes that hurt people don’t go unpunished.” Peterson, who pleaded guilty in February to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, did not speak during the hearing. In a letter to Gorton, Peterson said he was “ashamed and remorseful.” His lawyer, Carol Starkey, in court argued that he played a minor role in a scheme that his supervisor orchestrated. Peterson’s boss in Morgan Stanley’s Boston office, James Polese, pleaded guilty in April to related charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. According to his lawyers, in 2013 Peterson became friendly with an entrepreneur investing in wind farm projects and offered to help him raise money for a private equity fund called Commonwealth Bay that would invest in them. In 2014, Peterson, who had become a member of the fund’s board of directors, transferred $100,000 from the account of one of his clients without his permission to invest in a wind farm project, prosecutors said. He did so along with Polese, who had become an investor in the project, which needed financing, prosecutors said. Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an 86-year-old long-time client of Morgan Stanley to back a letter of credit in support of the wind farm project, prosecutors said. In addition, both men without approval in 2016 transferred $350,000 from that same client’s account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese’s own and family’s expenses, according to court papers. “Mr. Peterson took advantage of his clients and took their money for his own uses,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Bloom said. New York-based Morgan Stanley fired both men in June 2017. The bank has said that it immediately terminated them after uncovering their misconduct and reported the matter to authorities. In addition to the prison sentence, Peterson must pay $462,000 in restitution jointly with Polese.

It was a game nobody seemingly wanted to win. England made eight changes from the team who crushed Panama 6-1 while Belgium coach Roberto Martinez - who said pre-match that winning was not the priority - went one better, making nine alterations from the side who cruised to victory over Tunisia. It was a bizarre scene. A clash between two of Europe’s strongest sides, at the World Cup, where top spot in the group was up for grabs, and fans were booing inside the stadium as Belgium went from side to side in the first half and England allowed them to do so. The biggest cheers were reserved for yellow cards, adding to the hilarity of the spectacle. With England and Belgium locked on points and the same goal difference, fair play would decide who finished top if the game finished in a draw.  England started one caution behind Belgium, but the Belgians soon had two more to their name. Each foul was cheered by the Belgian fans with ironic cheers coming from the England contingent too. In the second half, Adnan Januzaj forgot the script as he curled in a brilliant goal to win the match for Martinez’s side, and England were unable, or unwilling, to find a leveller. This was nothing like as brazen as the infamous “Disgrace of Gijon” at the 1982 World Cup in Spain, where West Germany and Austria played out a mutually beneficial result to knock out Algeria. England had 11 shots but failed to score. They also mustered 11 shots in the match against Panama, netting six times. Some of those chances went close, with excellent interplay between Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy creating a big opportunity for the former, but he fired just wide. However, there was no effort from the England bench to find a way back in. Harry Kane has been in prolific form in Russia, netting five goals in his first two matches to lead the scoring charts. But the fact that he remained on the sidelines when England were supposedly chasing the game, and Danny Welbeck, who has started just one match for club or country since the end of April, came on instead, spoke volumes for England’s approach. “When you are leader and a manager you need to make decisions that are right for your group and sometimes those decisions will be criticised and I understand that,” England manager Gareth Southgate told reporters.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Taiwanese high-tech company Foxconn and vaguely threatened U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson on a campaign-style trip on Thursday to Wisconsin, a state that supported him in the 2016 election.  Against a backdrop of a growing trade conflict between the United States and China, Trump helped Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, to break ground on a 13,000-employee U.S. plant. “As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States. America is open for business,” Trump said. Trump also had words for Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N), which he has threatened with higher taxes if it moves production for European customers overseas. “Harley-Davidson, please build those beautiful motorcycles in the USA,” he said. “Don’t get cute with us, don’t get cute.”     Trump has levied tariffs on U.S. allies for what he considers unfair trade practices, sparking trade disputes that Harley-Davidson cited as its reason for moving some production overseas and which Foxconn has also cited as a major challenge.

The result means Belgium, who won all three of their group games to finish on nine points, will face Japan in the last 16 while England, who came second with six, take on Colombia. That gives Gareth Southgate’s England a tougher test in the second round but should they get past the South Americans they will find themselves on a much more promising path to the final. Belgium’s side of the draw includes Brazil, who they could face in the quarter-finals, Argentina, Portugal and France. England’s opponents are, on paper at least, easier — Sweden or Switzerland await in the last eight — and they face less travelling should they progress. “The knockout game is the biggest game for a decade, so we had to make sure our key players were preserved,” said Southgate, having left out captain Harry Kane among others. “We created openings to get something from the game, but we have to keep improving.

It was a game nobody seemingly wanted to win. England made eight changes from the team who crushed Panama 6-1 while Belgium coach Roberto Martinez - who said pre-match that winning was not the priority - went one better, making nine alterations from the side who cruised to victory over Tunisia. It was a bizarre scene. A clash between two of Europe’s strongest sides, at the World Cup, where top spot in the group was up for grabs, and fans were booing inside the stadium as Belgium went from side to side in the first half and England allowed them to do so. The biggest cheers were reserved for yellow cards, adding to the hilarity of the spectacle. With England and Belgium locked on points and the same goal difference, fair play would decide who finished top if the game finished in a draw.  England started one caution behind Belgium, but the Belgians soon had two more to their name. Each foul was cheered by the Belgian fans with ironic cheers coming from the England contingent too. In the second half, Adnan Januzaj forgot the script as he curled in a brilliant goal to win the match for Martinez’s side, and England were unable, or unwilling, to find a leveller. This was nothing like as brazen as the infamous “Disgrace of Gijon” at the 1982 World Cup in Spain, where West Germany and Austria played out a mutually beneficial result to knock out Algeria. England had 11 shots but failed to score. They also mustered 11 shots in the match against Panama, netting six times. Some of those chances went close, with excellent interplay between Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy creating a big opportunity for the former, but he fired just wide. However, there was no effort from the England bench to find a way back in. Harry Kane has been in prolific form in Russia, netting five goals in his first two matches to lead the scoring charts. But the fact that he remained on the sidelines when England were supposedly chasing the game, and Danny Welbeck, who has started just one match for club or country since the end of April, came on instead, spoke volumes for England’s approach. “When you are leader and a manager you need to make decisions that are right for your group and sometimes those decisions will be criticised and I understand that,” England manager Gareth Southgate told reporters. England play Colombia in the last 16 and, if they win that game, Sweden or Switzerland in the quarter-finals.

Nine defendants including Hormel Foods Corp (HRL.N), the JBS USA unit of Brazil’s JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), WH Group Ltd’s (0288.HK) Smithfield Foods Inc and Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) were accused of colluding since 2009 to limit production, with the “intent and expected result” of increasing pork prices. Thirteen individual consumers from around the country are seeking class-action status and a variety of damages for alleged overcharges since Jan. 1, 2009, in a complaint filed with the federal court in Minnesota. According to the complaint, U.S. pork sales totaled $18.9 billion in 2016, and the defendants and their co-conspirators control more than 80 percent of the wholesale market. Hormel said it intended to defend itself, and was confident that the allegations have no merit. Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson declined to comment. JBS and Smithfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case resembles litigation in Chicago federal court where consumers accused many companies, including Tyson and JBS’ majority-owned Pilgrim’s Pride, of conspiring to fix broiler chicken prices. According to Thursday’s complaint, the pork conspiracy began when the defendant Agri Stats Inc began giving pork companies “benchmarking” reports, which typically allow comparisons of profits and performance. But the consumers said Agri Stats went farther, offering “sensitive” data on costs, prices and slaughter rates and the ability to decipher which data belonged to which companies. They said this permitted the pork companies to monitor each other’s production, and as a result control supply and price. “The provision of this detailed information acts as the proverbial smoke-filled room of the cartels of yesteryear,” the complaint said. Agri Stats is also a defendant in the broiler chicken case. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thursday’s lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in St. Paul. The case is Duryea et al v. Agri Stats Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-01776.

The annual Trafficking in Persons report looked at 187 countries and territories and ranked them into four tiers. In a special section, the State Department said children should only be removed from their families as a “temporary, last resort.” John Sifton, an advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said the report “is an indictment of the Trump administration’s own policies with respect to asylum seekers and others seeking entry into the United States.” Since April, more than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policy for illegal immigrants. Children were kept in shelters while their parents waited to have their cases heard by a judge. Faced with criticism at home and abroad, Trump signed an executive order on June 20 requiring families be detained together for the duration of legal proceedings, but many could remain apart as legal challenges drag on. A senior State Department official said the United States has screening standards for trafficking indicators when children cross the border unaccompanied or are separated from their parents. Trafficking indicators can include children who eat apart from family members, travel unaccompanied by adults and children who have no time for playing, according to the United Nations.  The U.S. report downgraded Myanmar to its list of worst offenders, accusing the southeast Asian country of human trafficking and using child soldiers. A Tier 1 ranking is for countries that meet minimum U.S. standards; Tier 2 for those making significant efforts to do so; Tier 2 Watch List for those meriting special scrutiny; and Tier 3 for countries that fail to fully comply with the minimum U.S. standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. A Tier 3 ranking can trigger American sanctions limiting access to U.S. and international foreign assistance. Gabon, Laos, Papua New Guinea and Bolivia were downgraded to Tier 3 from the Tier 2 Watch List in the report, which is intended to spur countries into curbing human trafficking. “The world should know that we will not stop until human trafficking is a thing of the past,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a department event on Thursday where he and Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, honoured “heroes” fighting human trafficking around the world.  Meanwhile, Sudan was upgraded to the second-to-worst ranking at a time of improved relations between the U.S. and Khartoum. The U.S. lifted some sanctions against Sudan in October and is considering easing more. While the report is not meant to be influenced by geopolitical considerations, both the Trump and Obama administrations have been accused by human rights groups of prioritising economic and security interests over human trafficking concerns.  A Reuters examination in 2015 found that U.S. diplomats pressured the office charged with grading global efforts for the report into inflating assessments of 14 strategically important countries. As a result, Malaysia, Cuba and China and countries such as India, Uzbekistan and Mexico, received better grades than the State Department’s human rights experts wanted to give them, the sources said. Thailand and Pakistan were upgraded to Tier 2 this year, among a list of countries making significant efforts to comply. North Korea, China and Russia remained listed as some of the worst offenders. China was downgraded to Tier 3 last year. Iran and Niger were added to the child soldiers list, while Sudan was removed. Those countries can be restricted in receiving U.S. military aid. Iraq and Myanmar were put back on the list after being removed last year.

Edward DiMaria, 53, pleaded guilty in federal court in Miami to two counts, including conspiring to make false statements to accountants, falsify books and records and commit securities fraud, the U.S. Justice Department said. DiMaria, a resident of Fairfield County, Connecticut, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 11. His lawyer, Barry Berke, declined to comment. Bankrate, a consumer financial information provider, was acquired last year by privately held digital marketing company Red Ventures. Prosecutors alleged that from 2011 to 2014, DiMaria and others carried out a complex scheme to artificially inflate Bankrate’s earnings and misrepresent certain company expenses. At his guilty plea, DiMaria also admitted that he made false statements to Bankrate’s independent auditors to conceal improper accounting entries and caused the company’s financial statements to be misstated, the Justice Department said. Prosecutors said the scheme caused more than $25 million in losses to Bankrate’s shareholders. Bankrate in 2015 agreed to pay $15 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it engaged in accounting fraud to ensure that its financial results met analyst expectations.  Hyunjin Lerner, Bankrate’s former vice president of finance, pleaded guilty in October in connection with the scheme. He was sentenced in January to five years in prison.

They play Japan in the last 16 with the winners of that tie facing a tricky quarter-final against Brazil or Mexico.  Facing questions over whether he might have preferred to finish second — a draw or defeat would have had that effect and some fans began to suspect that was the Belgian plan after a tame first half — Martinez said: “Honestly, I am delighted.” Warming to a theme at this World Cup, he noted unpredictable narrow margins in the tournament that have sent defending champions Germany home and put 2014 runners-up Argentina into a second-round fight with 1998 champions France. “Making predictions in the World Cup can be a little bit difficult,” Martinez said, insisting Belgium would concentrate on Monday’s meeting with Japan in Rostov-on-Don.  He did not mention that victory could see Belgium meeting five-times champions Brazil, who are starting to find some form. France, Argentina and European champions Portugal also potentially lie in the way of Belgium’s latest “golden generation” reaching their nation’s first World Cup final. “We are not looking at paths,” Martinez said. “For now, Japan is the only priority that we have.” DIFFICULT TASK Gareth Southgate’s England by contrast face a difficult task in the next round against Colombia but are in the half of the draw in which the only other former champions are Spain. For Martinez, the key thing was that his second-string team, including nine changes from the lineup that put a total of eight goals past Panama and Tunisia, had comfortably overcome a similarly experimental England side. “We had an opportunity to show all the talent we have in the group,” he said. “Everyone in Belgium should be very proud.” Martinez said that to overcome years of underachievement by a country blessed with an abundance of talent it was critical to forge a deep sense of team spirit across the whole squad and to have strength in depth for the knockout campaign. “The so-called golden generation wasn’t playing today,” he said, after leaving the likes of Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne on the bench. Instead, youngsters like Youri Tielemans, 21, and Januzaj, 23, tested and stretched the England side. He was also able to try out with success Thomas Vermaelen, the Barcelona defender out injured for over a month, and later in the game to give a run out to defensive talisman Vincent Kompany, who had also yet to play in Russia due to injury. Martinez has now given all 20 outfield squad players a game in the World Cup so they all truly feel part of the campaign.

The deal’s potential to disrupt major players across the drug supply chain nationwide prompted a sell-off in shares of possible rivals, while sending Amazon shares up 2.5 percent. PillPack supplies pre-sorted prescription drugs and other services to people who take multiple medications, a growing market as the U.S. population ages and requires treatment for multiple complex, chronic conditions. Amazon is vying for a share of what is a more than $450 billion (£344.2 billion) total U.S. prescription drug market, according to research firm IQVIA. Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about $100 million this year, Amazon’s huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quickly.  Amazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance, according to industry experts. But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health, Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc, and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS, Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group. “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.   Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about $14 billion in market value on Thursday, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion. Shares of CVS closed down 6.1 percent, while Walgreen fell 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fell. JOINT VENTURE The news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated 1 million employees and dependents. Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon’s competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems. PillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country. But its expectation of over $100 million in 2018 revenue pales compared with larger rivals. CVS last year had about $45.7 billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business, accounting for about 15 percent of its pharmacy claims. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with them. Doctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs. With Amazon’s announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer/PBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts “are even more critical now.”   NOT WORRIED Walgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was “not particularly worried” about the PillPack deal. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,” Pessina said. That said, Pessina added, “We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction.” Some analysts played down the immediate threat. “I believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments,” said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies. He said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks, “especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume.” Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later. PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines. PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC reported in April. The Amazon deal is expected to close during the second half of 2018.

As my Reuters colleague Lawrence Hurley wrote yesterday, Justice Kennedy’s signature gay and abortion rights decisions will be back in play if the Senate confirms a reliably conservative nominee without Kennedy’s maverick streak. If you represent businesses, according to seven Supreme Court lawyers I talked to or corresponded with on Thursday, Justice Kennedy’s departure isn’t likely to prompt similar strategic consternation. Justice Kennedy was a solid supporter of businesses on key issues like arbitration and restricting class actions, they said. Any successor on President Trump’s announced list of candidates will be the same. So businesses, according to these lawyers, don’t have to worry about whether or not to ask the Supreme Court to take their cases in light of Justice Kennedy’s retirement. Their clients’ calculations are more or less the same. “If you go back to when Judge (Merrick) Garland was nominated, there was a lot of discussion in the business community about whether it made sense to hold off on bringing cases to the Supreme Court,” said Gregory Garre of Latham & Watkins. “Whoever the nominee is this time, that’s not going to be the case.” The Supreme Court lawyers did highlight a couple issues for businesses to watch as the court’s composition changes for the second time since Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in 2016: federal pre-emption of state law and punitive damages. Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily a staunch conservative, is a states-rights stalwart who frowns on federal pre-emption in such varied contexts as personal injury litigation and state-court arbitration. If President Trump’s next Supreme Court candidate is also a states-first federalist, said Carter Phillips of Sidley Austin, pre-emption could be “a huge issue.” In fact, the Supreme Court on Thursday granted review in a pre-emption case, Merck v. Albrecht, which presents the question of the FDA’s rejection of a proposed pharmaceutical warning label pre-empts state-law failure-to-warn claims. Justice Thomas also bucked his usual conservative allies back in 2003, when an unusual coalition of justices restricted punitive damages in State Farm v. Campbell (123 S.Ct. 1513). All of the justices in the majority of that opinion are now gone from the court except for Justice Stephen Breyer. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Thomas both dissented. If a plaintiff can persuade two more justices to take up the issue again, Phillips said, “all bets are off….The Chamber of Commerce should not be jumping up and down and clapping their hands until we find out who on that list is selected.” Strategy will come into play, Supreme Court lawyers said, in framing briefs and arguments for a court without Justice Kennedy. The lawyers I talked to said the trope of pitching arguments to an audience of one – Justice Kennedy acting as a swing vote – was always a bit of “overblown,” to borrow a word from Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, at least in business litigation. “Over-personalizing arguments can backfire,” said Shay Dvoretzky of Jones Day, who will be arguing the Merck pre-emption case. “Of course, you take into account what you know about individual justices’ approaches to the law and what they’ve said about particular issues. But that’s true for Justice Kennedy just as for other justices.” But it’s also true, said Lisa Blatt of Arnold & Porter, Kannon Shanmugam of William & Connolly and Daniel Geyser of Geyser PC, that good Supreme Court advocates tailor arguments to convince their very small audience of justices. Kennedy’s departure changes the composition of the court. So will the arrival, presumably, of a new conservative justice to take his place. After Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court in the spring of 2017, for instance, lawyers intensified arguments based on statutory texts and proposed ending long-standing precedent requiring the Supreme Court to defer to administrative agencies on statutory interpretation. They’ll make similar adjustments to the next new justice. Of course, even business lawyers don’t handle care just about business cases. Katyal said in an email that he’s disappointed Kennedy won’t be on the court to hear a death penalty appeal. Phillips said he had been counting on the prospect of support from Justice Kennedy in a pro bono case brought on behalf of Detroit public school students whose schools he describes as little more than warehouses. Phillips said he’s braced to lose in the trial court and at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “My only hope was the Supreme Court but I can only count to four now,” he said.","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/us-otc-kennedy/scotus-lawyers-for-business-clients-kennedy-exit-means-business-as-usual-for-now-idUKKBN1JO39E","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f59c"},{"title":"Malls, hospital evacuated in Russian World Cup city after bomb hoaxes","description":"Three shopping malls and a hospital were briefly evacuated in the Russian soccer World Cup host city of Samara on Thursday after a series of hoax bomb threats were phoned in, police and local media said.","author":"Jack Tarrant","pubDate":"2018-06-28T22:02:22+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"UK,SOCCER,WORLDCUP,SAMARA,EVACUATION,Russia,Western Europe,Picture available,Personalities / People,Africa,Central / Eastern Europe,Video,World Cup,Sport,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Soccer,Senegal,Pictures,Conflicts / War / Peace,Olympics,Americas,South America / Central America,CIS Countries,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Colombia,European Union,East European Countries,Europe,International / National Security,Bombing (Non,Military),Emerging Market Countries,Civil Unrest","contentText":"SAMARA, Russia (Reuters) - Three shopping malls and a hospital were briefly evacuated in the Russian soccer World Cup host city of Samara on Thursday after a series of hoax bomb threats were phoned in, police and local media said. The buildings re-opened within hours, but it was the second time in two days that such threats had disrupted a host city - police cleared bars and restaurants 1,300 km (800 miles) away in Rostov-on-Don on Wednesday morning. Police said in a statement they had carried out checks at an unspecified number of buildings after receiving a series of hoax bomb threats, but found nothing dangerous.  Emergency crews checked all three malls with sniffer dogs, then let shoppers back in, local media reported. An officer at one of the buildings said police had checked the building after receiving a message about a bomb, but found nothing. More than a dozen elderly patients were seen sitting on chairs outside a city hospital, accompanied by a doctor, in a photograph published by local media. A member of staff said the building had been briefly evacuated but was now working normally. Increasingly isolated on the global stage, Russia is keen to use the World Cup to project an image of stability and strength. Authorities have vowed to host a safe event and any security incidents involving fans could jeopardise Moscow’s efforts. Samara has hosted four group stage matches, including Colombia’s 1-0 win over Senegal earlier on Thursday. The city will host a match in the next round and a quarter-final. The local branch of the emergency situations ministry was not immediately available for comment.  Russia was subject to a wave of hoax bomb threats last summer, causing disruption at businesses and public buildings in towns and cities across the country. The Russian Federal Security Service said in October it had identified four Russian citizens behind the hoax campaign, who were living abroad and using internet phone services to call in the threats anonymously.

Instead, youngsters like Youri Tielemans, 21, and Januzaj, 23, tested and stretched the England side. He was also able to try out with success Thomas Vermaelen, the Barcelona defender out injured for over a month, and later in the game to give a run out to defensive talisman Vincent Kompany, who had also yet to play in Russia due to injury. Martinez has now given all 20 outfield squad players a game in the World Cup so they all truly feel part of the campaign.

As the U.S. July 4 Independence Day holiday nears, public health officials hope sun protection, sunburn and sun safety stays at the top of people’s minds while they celebrate the nation’s favorite summer holidays. “Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the U.S., yet it is highly preventable,” said lead study author Jenn Nguyen of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.  Don’t Fry Day is a national campaign sponsored by the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention that promotes sun safety awareness on social media. Promoted every year on the weekend before the Memorial Day holiday in late May, the hashtag #DontFryDay encourages safe sun habits at the start of summer. “We found that many of the accounts that tweeted the hashtag were health-oriented,” Nguyen told Reuters Health by email. “The majority of the tweets were from individuals who may be already aware of skin cancer and sun protection.” Nguyen and colleagues tracked the conversation about #DontFryDay on Twitter during the five days around May 26, 2017, including tweets, retweets and potential impressions, which show how many users could have seen the tweet.  They found that 555 users without verified accounts made 39 retweets and garnered 747,000 impressions. However, the 18 individuals, mainly celebrities, with verified accounts made the biggest difference with 39 retweets and 8.7 million impressions, the study team reports in JAMA Dermatology.  In particular, basketball player Dwayne Wade, a guard for the Miami Heat, accounted for most of the celebrity impact. His tweet addressed heat stroke prevention - not sun safety - but included the DontFryDay hashtag.  “So many myths need to be busted when it comes to sun protection and sun exposure,” said Sherry Pagoto of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, who wasn’t involved with the study. “Some people think tanning is safe, that it’s a healthy look and that sunscreen causes cancer,” she said in a phone interview. “Public health officials have their work cut out for them.” In their Twitter analysis, Nguyen and colleagues found that 34 news organizations sent messages that made 2.5 million impressions, health and nongovernmental organizations made 1.5 million impressions, cancer and health centers reached 1.3 million and government entities reached about 1 million. “This speaks to the power of celebrities and influencers in helping us get the message out there,” Pagoto said. “At the same time, it also speaks to the importance of scientists building their own social media audience as well.” As they continue to analyze this year’s Don’t Fry Day campaign, Nguyen and others will investigate the messages that were associated with the hashtag and which ones seemed to be the most effective at engaging Twitter users. Similarly, Pagoto and her colleagues are studying social media to learn how people talk about and learn about healthy and unhealthy behaviors. They’re particularly focused on tanning beds, tanning safety and sun safety. “It’s important to know who people are listening to and how they get their information,” she said. “It’s a great way to understand where they’re coming from and what they believe.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2KfbmQB JAMA Dermatology, online June 20, 2018.","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/us-health-skin-sun/dont-fry-day-campaign-encourages-summer-holiday-sun-safety-idUKKBN1JO396","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5a1"},{"title":"Soccer-Ouch!","description":"Michy Batshuayi was quick to see the funny side after his celebration of Belgium's winning World Cup goal over England ended with him being smacked hard in the face by the ball.","author":"Reuters Editorial","pubDate":"2018-06-28T22:00:30+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"SOCCER,WORLDCUP,ENG,BEL/BATSHUAYI (PIX,TV),Belgium,Russia,Western Europe,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,England,Central / Eastern Europe,World Cup,Sport,Asia / Pacific,Soccer,United Kingdom,Social Media,Society / Social Issues,Living / Lifestyle,CIS Countries,Euro Zone,General News,Internet / World Wide Web,Europe,Emerging Market Countries","contentText":"KALININGRAD, Russia, June 28 (Reuters) - Michy Batshuayi was quick to see the funny side after his celebration of Belgium’s winning World Cup goal over England ended with him being smacked hard in the face by the ball. “Why am I so stupid bro,” the Borussia Dortmund striker tweeted after video loops went viral of him lashing the ball against the post following Adnan Januzaj’s second-half goal, only for it to rebound at close range and hit him.

Cornelius Peterson, 29, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston, who said the former financial adviser deserved a significant prison term for misusing around $500,000 from two clients’ accounts. “You were someone who didn’t need the money,” Gorton said. “Well, today you find that fraud and financial crimes that hurt people don’t go unpunished.” Peterson, who pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy, investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, did not speak during the hearing. But his lawyer, Carol Starkey, said he played a minor role in the scheme, which his supervisor orchestrated. Peterson’s boss in the Boston office of Morgan Stanley, James Polese, pleaded guilty in April to charges that he used clients’ funds to make his own investments and to pay personal expenses. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. According to his lawyers, in 2013, Peterson became friendly with an entrepreneur investing in windfarm projects and offered to help him raise money for a private equity fund called Commonwealth Bay that would invest in them. Without a client’s consent, in 2014, Peterson, who had become a member of the fund’s board of directors, transferred $100,000 from the account of one of his clients to invest in a windfarm project, prosecutors said. He did so along with Polese, who had become an investor in the project, which needed financing, prosecutors said. Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an 86-year-old long-time client of Morgan Stanley to back a letter of credit in support of the wind farm project, prosecutors said. In addition, both men without approval in 2016 transferred $350,000 from that same client’s account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese’s own and family’s expenses, according to court papers. “Mr. Peterson took advantage of his clients and took their money for his own uses,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Bloom said in court. New York-based Morgan Stanley fired both men in June 2017. The bank has said that it immediately terminated them after uncovering their misconduct and reported the matter to authorities. In addition to the prison sentence, Peterson must pay $462,000 in restitution jointly with Polese.

The deal’s potential to disrupt major players across the drug supply chain nationwide prompted a sell-off in shares of possible rivals, while sending Amazon shares up 2.5 percent. PillPack supplies pre-sorted prescription drugs and other services to people who take multiple medications, a growing market as the U.S. population ages and requires treatment for multiple complex, chronic conditions. Amazon is vying for a share of what is a more than $450 billion (£344.2 billion) total U.S. prescription drug market, according to research firm IQVIA. Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about $100 million this year, Amazon’s huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quickly.  Amazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance, according to industry experts. But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health, Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc, and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS, Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group. “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.   Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about $14 billion in market value on Thursday, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion. Shares of CVS closed down 6.1 percent, while Walgreen fell 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fell. JOINT VENTURE The news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated 1 million employees and dependents. Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon’s competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems. PillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country. But its expectation of over $100 million in 2018 revenue pales compared with larger rivals. CVS last year had about $45.7 billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business, accounting for about 15 percent of its pharmacy claims. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with them. Doctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs. With Amazon’s announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer/PBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts “are even more critical now.”   NOT WORRIED Walgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was “not particularly worried” about the PillPack deal. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,” Pessina said. That said, Pessina added, “We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction.” Some analysts played down the immediate threat. “I believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments,” said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies. He said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks, “especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume.” Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later. PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines. PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC reported in April. The Amazon deal is expected to close during the second half of 2018.

John Galanis, 74; Devon Archer, 44; and Bevan Cooney, 45, were convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud following a 5-1/2-week trial, according to a statement from the office of Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami. “As a unanimous jury swiftly found, these defendants orchestrated a highly complex scheme to defraud a Native American community and multiple pension funds, all to corruptly bankroll their own personal and business interests,” Khuzami said in a statement. Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. Galanis is already serving a six-year sentence for a separate financial fraud involving manipulation of the stock of now-defunct reinsurer Gerova Financial Group Ltd. His son, Jason Galanis, has pleaded guilty to taking part in both the Gerova and tribal bond schemes, for which he has been sentenced to more than 11 years and five years, respectively. Prosecutors said John Galanis persuaded an entity affiliated with South Dakota’s Oglala Sioux Nation to issue bonds, using false representations. Jason Galanis, Archer and Cooney fraudulently induced pension funds to invest in the bonds through an investment adviser firm they controlled, according to prosecutors.

Maw, 50, lasted just four years in the CFO role. The company did not provide details on what prompted the retirement. “Our discussions with the company indicate that Mr. Maw’s decision was of a personal nature,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a research note. “Plans to identify roughly $300 million in cost savings over the next three years remain unchanged.” Starbucks had strong sales growth and topped analyst earnings estimates during the first half of Maw’s tenure but  stumbled more recently, with the company’s chief executive earlier this month calling its performance “not acceptable.” The Seattle-based company said in a regulatory filing that it had launched an external search for a replacement for Maw, who will become a senior consultant until March 31, 2019, earning $250,000 per month.  “As we enter our next phase of continued growth, I am confident in the finance team Scott has developed and am appreciative of his willingness to support through the transition into new leadership,” Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in a statement.  It was Starbucks’ second high-profile departure announced in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Executive Chairman Howard Schultz said he would step away from the company, effective this week. Analysts were stunned by Maw’s retirement, pointing to his relatively young age and short stint as CFO. Some described him as a competent executive, but also noted the chain’s deteriorating performance and outlook in recent quarters. “We believe the departure of Mr. Maw - who we viewed as a capable leader – will be perceived be as a loss for SBUX in the near and long-term,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a research note.  Maw was promoted to CFO in February 2014, and his first two years in the role were marked by a pickup in comparable store sales growth and Starbucks consistently topping Wall Street earnings forecasts.  But the coffee chain fell short of analyst estimates for same-store sales in the Americas region in five of the last six quarters. Last week it forecast slower sales growth than expected this quarter and said it plans to shutter about 150 U.S. cafes next fiscal year, triple its normal number of closures. “The sudden nature of this announcement and Maw’s relatively young age and tenure in his role suggest the decision (to) leave was perhaps not entirely voluntary,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note. “While a new CFO may bring greater experience in the types of capital allocation strategies we have advocated, the fundamentals of the business need to at least stabilize and the responsibility for that lies with SBUX’s CEO and COO.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-cfo/starbucks-cfo-maw-to-retire-shares-tumble-idUKKBN1JO24M","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5a9"},{"title":"Walgreens debuts as dog of the Dow","description":"The debut of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc into the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index  this week marks the worst performance of any new entrant in the past 10 years, a Reuters analysis shows.","author":"James Thorne","pubDate":"2018-06-28T21:53:23+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"US,USA,STOCKS,WALGREENS,BOOTS,Company News,Picture available,Aerospace / Defense (Legacy),Drug Retailers (TRBC),Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC),Graphics,Equities Markets,Internet / World Wide Web,Heavy Electrical Equipment (TRBC),Industrial Conglomerates (TRBC),Department Stores (TRBC),Pictures,United States,Aerospace and Defense (TRBC)","contentText":"(Reuters) - The debut of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) into the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index .DJI this week marks the worst performance of any new entrant in the past 10 years, a Reuters analysis shows.

Walgreens shares were down more than 11 percent in the three days after the company replaced General Electric Co (GE.N) in the index on Tuesday.  (Graphic: Three-day share price performance following a Dow debut tmsnrt.rs/2Kr8hJk) The No. 2 U.S. pharmacy chain by market cap lost 9.9 percent on Thursday, becoming the day’s biggest loser of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. It trimmed more than 44 points off the index, which shrugged off early losses to close the day up 98 points, or 0.4 percent. While Walgreens performed like dog on debut, it would not today qualify as one of the “Dogs of the Dow,” under an investment strategy based on selecting 10 Dow stocks at year end with the highest dividend yields.  Walgreens’ annual dividend is 2.4 percent, above the S&P average yield of just under 2 percent, but below the 10 actual “Dogs” with yields above 3 percent.  GE shares have risen more than 8 percent since the company was dropped from the Dow, giving it the best three-day performance among those that recently left the index. GE left the Dow with the lowest share price and least amount of influence in the index, which is derived from an average of stock prices among constituent companies. GE said on Tuesday that it would sell its oil-services firm Baker Hughes HBGE.N and spin off its healthcare business, leaving a slimmed-down company focused on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy. Eight of the 11 most recent companies to join the Dow have seen share prices decline in the three days following a debut.

Tunisia trailed 1-0 at halftime in the final Group G match in Saransk despite having the better of play. Fakhreddine Ben Yousseff equalised just after the restart with a neatly-taken goal and Wahbi Khazri scored a second to end Tunisia’s long drought. The result brought some vindication for the North Africans, who coach Nabil Maaloul had admitted before the game were demoralised after their defeats by England and Belgium. But it was tough for Panama, making their first appearance in a World Cup finals, and for their fans in the Monrovia Arena  who for a while could dream of a historic win. “We wanted to snatch this victory, and I wanted to score, and I did. This is a great day for Tunisia,” said man of the match Ben Yousseff. Tunisia played fluent football but Panama took the lead after a shot by Jose Luis Rodriguez took a deflection off Tunisian defender Yassine Meriah in the 33rd minute for an own goal. Having failed to finish off several chances in the first half, Tunisia took six minutes to assert themselves after the restart. Ben Yousseff picked up a low cross from Khazri to slot the ball home from close range. Khazri added the second in the 66th minute, running unmarked on to a low cross to tap into an open goal. Panama suffered when captain Roman Torres, who had marshalled the defence well, departed with an injury early in the second half. ANXIOUS MOMENTS Still, they pushed hard for an equaliser and caused anxious moments for Tunisia as the clock ticked away but lacked the killer instinct. The two teams had already been eliminated from the tournament before the match started, both having lost to England and Belgium. But the spirited duel and the fervour of the more than 37,000 fans in the Mordovia Arena belied the notion that this was a pointless match between two lowly nations. The Eagles of Carthage, making their fifth appearance in the World Cup finals, had not won a game since beating Mexico in Argentina in 1978 to become the first African country to notch up a victory at the tournament. “Perhaps in the second match we should have been better. Our performance against England was very good...we should have been more defensive against Belgium,” Tunisia coach Maaloul said. Tunisia joined Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Egypt in failing to break out of the group stage while Panama fly home as one of only two nations to lose all three games and with the most goals conceded. But coach Hernan Gomez says Panama have learned massively from the experience in Russia. “We were much more level in this match than in others,” he said.

Tunisia were beaten 2-1 by England in their opening match and thumped 5-2 by Belgium in their second, ending their hopes of progressing to the knockout stages before their final group game. But the North Africans fly home with a sense of satisfaction after ending a 40-year wait for a World Cup victory with their come-from-behind win over Panama at the Mordovia Arena. “Today’s match was a well-deserved win for the Tunisian side.

Tunisia became the first African country to win a game at a World Cup when they beat Mexico in Argentina in 1978, but had since drawn four matches and lost nine before Thursday’s victory.

The announcement that Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) would acquire online pharmacy PillPack sank shares in Walgreens and other drug retailers on Thursday. Walgreens shares were down more than 11 percent in the three days after the company replaced General Electric Co (GE.N) in the index on Tuesday.  (Graphic: Three-day share price performance following a Dow debut tmsnrt.rs/2Kr8hJk) The No. 2 U.S. pharmacy chain by market cap lost 9.9 percent on Thursday, becoming the day’s biggest loser of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. It trimmed more than 44 points off the index, which shrugged off early losses to close the day up 98 points, or 0.4 percent. While Walgreens performed like dog on debut, it would not today qualify as one of the “Dogs of the Dow,” under an investment strategy based on selecting 10 Dow stocks at year end with the highest dividend yields.  Walgreens’ annual dividend is 2.4 percent, above the S&P average yield of just under 2 percent, but below the 10 actual “Dogs” with yields above 3 percent.  GE shares have risen more than 8 percent since the company was dropped from the Dow, giving it the best three-day performance among those that recently left the index. GE left the Dow with the lowest share price and least amount of influence in the index, which is derived from an average of stock prices among constituent companies. GE said on Tuesday that it would sell its oil-services firm Baker Hughes HBGE.N and spin off its healthcare business, leaving a slimmed-down company focused on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy. Eight of the 11 most recent companies to join the Dow have seen share prices decline in the three days following a debut.

At an EU summit focussed more on a crisis over migration than Brexit, May came under pressure to move on with the all-but-stalled talks and consider softening some of her “red lines” to prevent Britain from crashing out of the bloc without a deal. She has hesitated to spell out detailed plans for Britain’s departure from the EU because of divisions in her ruling Conservative Party and government over the terms of Britain’s biggest foreign policy shift in almost half a century. But in an attempt to get some control back over the talks, May used a dinner with EU leaders to underline Britain’s role in keeping Europe safe, sharing information freely to solve serious crimes and prevent militant attacks. “Our ability to do so is being put at risk,” May told other EU leaders, according to a senior UK government official. “The existing legal frameworks for third countries will not allow us to realise the ambitious future security partnership that I believe is in all our interests ... That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either.” With only nine months before Britain leaves the EU, May is under increasing pressure in Brussels not only to come up with ways to settle a divorce agreement, including a proposal for a new border on the island of Ireland, but also to detail her vision for future ties once outside the bloc. Earlier, EU leaders were blunt in their assessment of progress so far, and called on May to soften her red lines such as leaving the bloc’s customs union, which has complicated a desire for no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland that could stir sectarian tensions. “We did expect that we would make more progress, or any progress, at this summit in June ... There hasn’t been,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters before meeting May discuss the border. MAY PLAYS STRONGEST CARD May has promised to resolve differences among her top team of ministers at a meeting early next month and intends to present a policy document setting out the government’s aims for a future partnership after that. Her government’s indecision has prompted several large companies in Britain to warn the government that a disorderly Brexit could put thousands of jobs at risk, and for the EU to repeatedly say time is running out to secure an agreement by October to give countries time to ratify the deal. She has so far stuck to what the EU called her “red lines” - to leave the bloc’s single market and customs union. And while security is seen by British officials as one of the country’s strongest cards to play in the talks, another of her pledges - to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - has made continued cooperation more difficult.  The EU says Britain must become a “third country” after Brexit, losing its participation in several of its security data bases which hold intelligence and help track criminals. But May said that would mean no longer being able to share information about wanted people or terrorist networks in Europe. “So when you meet ... tomorrow, I would urge you to consider what is in the best interests of safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/protect-your-people-may-urges-eu-leaders-idUKKBN1JO25M","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5b0"},{"title":"Record-high U.S. June hog herd faces pork demand uncertainty","description":"* Trade spats cloud U.S. pork export outlook","author":"Reuters Editorial","pubDate":"2018-06-28T21:43:22+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"USA,HOGS/USDA,Agricultural Markets,Oilseeds,Derivatives,Pork Bellies,Food and Tobacco (TRBC),Food Processing (Legacy),Non,Cyclical Consumer Goods and Services (TRBC),Pigs / Hogs,Canada,United States,Commodities Markets,Americas,Corn,Meals / Feeds / Pulses,Food and Beverages (TRBC),Beef,Beverages (Legacy),Soybean,Cattle,Grains,Livestock,Pork,United States Department of Agriculture","contentText":"* Trade spats cloud U.S. pork export outlook * Report called neutral-bearish for futures By Theopolis Waters CHICAGO, June 28 (Reuters) - The hog population on U.S. farms in the March-May quarter was up  3.4 percent year-on-year, a record high for the quarter, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture quarterly hog/pig report on Thursday. Farmers grew their herds, bolstered by record numbers of baby pigs, to feed four new packing plants that came online since late 2017, said analysts. More hogs in the pipeline present a demand challenge after China in early April tacked extra tariffs on U.S. pork after Washington imposed higher duties on Chinese steel and aluminum. Mexico will allow in U.S. pork under a quota system despite initial retaliatory measures in response to higher Mexican steel and aluminum imports tariffs set by U.S. President Donald Trump. “This could be risky fourth quarter in terms of producer profitability given the large supplies coming into the marketplace and the uncertain demand dimension,” said Livestock Marketing Information Center director Jim Robb. “It could be more red ink than normal,” he added. Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities, said Thursday’s report confirms that aggressive herd expansion was underway. Record pigs per litter speaks to farmer efficiency in raising piglets, he said. A previous USDA supply/demand report had forecast increased U.S. pork exports and domestic demand, which is expected to absorb the buildup in supplies, said Roose. “Those are very much uncertain, particularly when you’re talking about the potential trade concerns,” said Roose. Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog futures on Friday may have a neutral to bearish reaction to the report, said analysts. Thursday’s USDA report showed the U.S. hog herd as of June 1 at 103.4 percent of the year-ago level or 73.451 million head, the most ever for that period since the government began tabulating the data in 1964. Analysts’ average forecast was 73.140 million head. The U.S. breeding herd was 103.5 percent of the year-ago level, at 6.320 million head, up from 6.109 million last year. The average trade forecast was 6.210 million. The June 1 supply of market-ready hogs for sale to packers was 103.4 percent of a year earlier, at 67.131 million head, up from 64.901 million last year.

The pension funds’ total assets dipped by $27.8 billion, or 0.7 percent, from the prior quarter to $3.78 trillion. It was the first time totals have fallen since September 2015. Total contributions into the funds also dipped, from both employees and government employers, while benefit payments rose slightly. The underwhelming first quarter performance was driven by several factors, particularly equity volatility, according to Roy Eappen, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. It was a stark change from the certainty that prevailed in the fourth quarter of 2017, when fiscal and monetary policy and tax reform legislation all provided a level of clarity, Eappen said. The start of 2018 can be seen as coming off the “high” of 2017, which was “a very good year,” he said. In fact, the total dollar figure of returns on public pension investments in 2017 was nearly $528 billion, a sum exceeding any annual total in at least the prior 20 years, according to a Reuters analysis of Census data. Early this year, discussion of a possible trade war with China, lower than expected retail sales and revisions to gross domestic product all combined to heighten market uncertainty and undercut equities, Eappen said. The S&P 500 Index S&P took a nosedive in February, erasing nearly all the gains it made in January to end the quarter up just 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, the CBOE Market Volatility Index also jumped in February and stayed somewhat elevated through March.

FC Dallas aim to bounce back from a 3-0 drubbing to the New York Red Bulls when they visit Minnesota United FC on Friday night. The Red Bulls were dominant in all areas on Saturday while halting FC Dallas’ unbeaten streak at seven games and win streak at four. The setback leaves FC Dallas (8-2-5, 29 points) three behind first-place Sporting Kansas City, with a game at hand. Now the goal is to set aside the unpleasant residue and rebound quickly. “This is such a long season, we’re professionals and we’ve been through this before,” FC Dallas defender Ryan Hollingshead told reporters. “You can’t let one loss get to you, so we put that one behind us a while ago and we’re ready to move forward.” FC Dallas were shut out for the first time this season in the contest against the Red Bulls but should get chances to reinvigorate the attack against the Loons, who allowed seven goals in back-to-back road setbacks against Sporting KC and the Colorado Rapids. Minnesota United (5-9-1) are playing at home for the first time since May 26 and have been significantly better at TCF Bank Stadium, going 4-2-1 on the friendly pitch compared to 1-7-0 on the road. “Home is home,” Loons coach Adrian Heath told reporters. “In this league, it proves to be the place where most teams get their points. We have been competitive at home every game we have played this season. I do not expect anything different this weekend.” Forward Christian Ramirez leads Minnesota with four goals. Midfielders Miguel Ibarra and Darwin Quintero have three apiece. However, Ibarra will be forced to sit out the contest after receiving a red card during a fracas between the Loons and Colorado during Saturday’s 3-2 defeat. The FC Dallas offense is led by midfielder Roland Lamah and forward Maxi Urruti, who each have six goals.

Tunisia trailed 1-0 at halftime in the final Group G match in Saransk despite having the better of play. Fakhreddine Ben Yousseff equalised just after the restart with a neatly-taken goal and Wahbi Khazri scored a second to end Tunisia’s long drought. The result brought some vindication for the North Africans, who coach Nabil Maaloul had admitted before the game were demoralised after their defeats by England and Belgium. But it was tough for Panama, making their first appearance in a World Cup finals, and for their fans in the Monrovia Arena who for a while could dream of a historic win. “We wanted to snatch this victory, and I wanted to score, and I did. This is a great day for Tunisia,” said man of the match Ben Yousseff. Tunisia played fluent football but Panama took the lead after a shot by Jose Luis Rodriguez took a deflection off Tunisian defender Yassine Meriah in the 33rd minute for an own goal. Having failed to finish off several chances in the first half, Tunisia took six minutes to assert themselves after the restart. Ben Yousseff picked up a low cross from Khazri to slot the ball home from close range. Khazri added the second in the 66th minute, running unmarked on to a low cross to tap into an open goal. Panama suffered when captain Roman Torres, who had marshalled the defence well, departed with an injury early in the second half. ANXIOUS MOMENTS Still, they pushed hard for an equaliser and caused anxious moments for Tunisia as the clock ticked away but lacked the killer instinct. The two teams had already been eliminated from the tournament before the match started, both having lost to England and Belgium. But the spirited duel and the fervour of the more than 37,000 fans in the Mordovia Arena belied the notion that this was a pointless match between two lowly nations. The Eagles of Carthage, making their fifth appearance in the World Cup finals, had not won a game since beating Mexico in Argentina in 1978 to become the first African country to notch up a victory at the tournament. “Perhaps in the second match we should have been better. Our performance against England was very good...we should have been more defensive against Belgium,” Tunisia coach Maaloul said. Tunisia joined Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Egypt in failing to break out of the group stage while Panama fly home as one of only two nations to lose all three games and with the most goals conceded. But coach Hernan Gomez says Panama have learned massively from the experience in Russia. “We were much more level in this match than in others,” he said.

Maw, 50, lasted just four years in the CFO role. The company did not provide details on what prompted the retirement. “Our discussions with the company indicate that Mr. Maw’s decision was of a personal nature,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a research note. “Plans to identify roughly $300 million in cost savings over the next three years remain unchanged.” Starbucks had strong sales growth and topped analyst earnings estimates during the first half of Maw’s tenure but  stumbled more recently, with the company’s chief executive earlier this month calling its performance “not acceptable.” The Seattle-based company said in a regulatory filing that it had launched an external search for a replacement for Maw, who will become a senior consultant until March 31, 2019, earning $250,000 per month.  “As we enter our next phase of continued growth, I am confident in the finance team Scott has developed and am appreciative of his willingness to support through the transition into new leadership,” Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in a statement.  It was Starbucks’ second high-profile departure announced in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Executive Chairman Howard Schultz said he would step away from the company, effective this week. Analysts were stunned by Maw’s retirement, pointing to his relatively young age and short stint as CFO. Some described him as a competent executive, but also noted the chain’s deteriorating performance and outlook in recent quarters. “We believe the departure of Mr. Maw - who we viewed as a capable leader – will be perceived be as a loss for SBUX in the near and long-term,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a research note.  Maw was promoted to CFO in February 2014, and his first two years in the role were marked by a pickup in comparable store sales growth and Starbucks consistently topping Wall Street earnings forecasts.  But the coffee chain fell short of analyst estimates for same-store sales in the Americas region in five of the last six quarters. Last week it forecast slower sales growth than expected this quarter and said it plans to shutter about 150 U.S. cafes next fiscal year, triple its normal number of closures. “The sudden nature of this announcement and Maw’s relatively young age and tenure in his role suggest the decision (to) leave was perhaps not entirely voluntary,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note. “While a new CFO may bring greater experience in the types of capital allocation strategies we have advocated, the fundamentals of the business need to at least stabilize and the responsibility for that lies with SBUX’s CEO and COO.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/starbucks-cfo/update-3-starbucks-cfo-maw-to-retire-shares-tumble-idUKL4N1TU4TW","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5b8"},{"title":"Chad, Glencore finalise restructuring of oil-backed loan","description":"Chad and Glencore have signed a final agreement to restructure an oil-backed loan of more than $1 billion (£0.7 billion), the government of the West African country said in a statement on Thursday.","author":"Reuters Editorial","pubDate":"2018-06-28T21:34:32+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"UK,GLENCORE,CHAD,Corporate Debt Renegotiation,Switzerland,Company News,Crude Oil,Financials (Legacy),Government / Politics,Africa,Credit and Corporate Debt,Oil and Gas (TRBC),Chad,Europe / Middle East / Africa (Energy),Africa Crudes,Refined Products,Mining,National Government Debt,Europe,United Kingdom,Loans","contentText":"DAKAR (Reuters) - Chad and Glencore have signed a final agreement to restructure an oil-backed loan of more than $1 billion (£0.7 billion), the government of the West African country said in a statement on Thursday.

At an EU summit focussed more on a crisis over migration than Brexit, May came under pressure to move on with the all-but-stalled talks and consider softening some of her “red lines” to prevent Britain from crashing out of the bloc without a deal. She has hesitated to spell out detailed plans for Britain’s departure from the EU because of divisions in her ruling Conservative Party and government over the terms of Britain’s biggest foreign policy shift in almost half a century. But in an attempt to get some control back over the talks, May used a dinner with EU leaders to underline Britain’s role in keeping Europe safe, sharing information freely to solve serious crimes and prevent militant attacks. “Our ability to do so is being put at risk,” May told other EU leaders, according to a senior UK government official. “The existing legal frameworks for third countries will not allow us to realise the ambitious future security partnership that I believe is in all our interests ... That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either.” With only nine months before Britain leaves the EU, May is under increasing pressure in Brussels not only to come up with ways to settle a divorce agreement, including a proposal for a new border on the island of Ireland, but also to detail her vision for future ties once outside the bloc. Earlier, EU leaders were blunt in their assessment of progress so far, and called on May to soften her red lines such as leaving the bloc’s customs union, which has complicated a desire for no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland that could stir sectarian tensions. “We did expect that we would make more progress, or any progress, at this summit in June ... There hasn’t been,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters before meeting May discuss the border. MAY PLAYS STRONGEST CARD May has promised to resolve differences among her top team of ministers at a meeting early next month and intends to present a policy document setting out the government’s aims for a future partnership after that. Her government’s indecision has prompted several large companies in Britain to warn the government that a disorderly Brexit could put thousands of jobs at risk, and for the EU to repeatedly say time is running out to secure an agreement by October to give countries time to ratify the deal. She has so far stuck to what the EU called her “red lines” - to leave the bloc’s single market and customs union. And while security is seen by British officials as one of the country’s strongest cards to play in the talks, another of her pledges - to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - has made continued cooperation more difficult.  The EU says Britain must become a “third country” after Brexit, losing its participation in several of its security data bases which hold intelligence and help track criminals. But May said that would mean no longer being able to share information about wanted people or terrorist networks in Europe. “So when you meet ... tomorrow, I would urge you to consider what is in the best interests of safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective.” ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/britain-eu/update-1-protect-your-people-britains-may-urges-eu-leaders-idUKL8N1TU5LR","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5bc"},{"title":"Satellite tech offers near real-time view of deforestation:...","description":"In 2015, satellite images detected a fresh clearing of rainforest in an indigenous reserve deep in the Amazon.","author":"Reuters Editorial","pubDate":"2018-06-28T21:29:49+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"US,PERU,ENVIRONMENT,Americas,Gold,South America / Central America,Picture available,Environment,Video,Brazil,Nature / Wildlife,General News,Technology (TRBC),Mining,Metals Markets,Peru,Science,Pictures,United States","contentText":"LIMA (Reuters) - In 2015, satellite images detected a fresh clearing of rainforest in an indigenous reserve deep in the Amazon.  Within months, authorities in Peru had evicted the wildcat miners driving the deforestation, a rare victory in a region where a gold rush has laid waste to large swaths of pristine forest. The rapid response was possible thanks to better use of satellite technology that now allows deforestation to be tracked in near real-time, giving governments “unprecedented” opportunities to take action, said Matt Finer, the lead author of a paper on the trend in the latest issue of Science. Instead of years passing before learning about a new  deforestation hotspot, authorities can track it in weeks or months, said Finer. “Most tropical countries now cannot say, ‘well we didn’t have the information, or we didn’t have the information on time’,” said Finer, a research specialist at the organization Amazon Conservation, which spotted the 2015 clearing in Peru’s Amarakaeri Communal Reserve. Satellites have gradually been capturing more frequent images of the world’s tropical forests with greater detail. In recent years, researchers at the University of Maryland developed an automated early-warning system to notify authorities of likely forest loss, said Finer. Algorithms can further filter the data by pointing to particularly troublesome patterns, such as the loss of green forest cover inside protected reserves or lines suggesting new roads have been cut through primary rainforest, said Finer. Daniel Castillo, the head of a team in Peru’s environment ministry that uses the technology, said finding out about deforestation early on can keep it from spinning out of control. He pointed to the expansion of illegal gold mining in southern Peru that is now a key driver of the region’s economy. “It’s now much more complicated to control,” said Castillo. “If we can identify it early, and take corresponding actions, it can be controlled.” The so-called GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) alerts developed at the University of Maryland now cover more than 20 countries with tropical forest, Finer said. Peru and Brazil have also developed their own early-warning deforestation systems tailored to their needs, Finer added. Castillo said his team analyzes deforestation alerts based on Landsat images taken every 8-10 days, and passes worrisome trends on to authorities in other ministries. “We have all the tools to be able tell when this kind of phenomena occurs, we only really need effective action,” Castillo said.

Both England and Belgium went into the match in Kaliningrad knowing they had qualified for the last 16, but the atmosphere among England fans after the game was more subdued than celebratory.  “Dull, boring, lifeless - nothing else to say really. But we’re going to win the World Cup anyway so don’t worry about us!” said Leighton from Liverpool.   With both teams qualified, much of the pre-game talk had revolved around speculation a second-place group finish might offer an easier path through the tournament as it avoided a potential clash with Brazil.  Fans like Tom, 26, from Milton Keynes chided England, saying they had fielded a weaker side showing eight changes from the team who crushed Panama 6-1. He said the strategy had backfired as the loss meant Gareth Southgate’s side finished second in Group G and face Group H winners Colombia next, rather than Japan who play Belgium.  “Absolute disgrace. You play your best team. If it’s not good enough, then so be it,” he said.  “We’ve got a harder game now in the last 16. We were too busy being concerned about avoiding Brazil in the quarter-final and now we might not even get there,” he said.  The atmosphere among England fans outside the stadium in Kaliningrad was quiet with a few fans chanting “We’re on our way!”   Graham Waites, 57, who had travelled to the game from Sweden, was less critical of the performance.  “Belgium maybe deserved to win, but nobody was really playing so far because we’d already qualified. But it was disappointing because we want to keep winning to keep building confidence in the team,” he said.  He was unsure if England would overcome Colombia. “Who knows, Colombia, sometimes they play brilliant, other times they are disorganised. Hopefully, we will be more organised,” he said.

The technology sector rose 1.1 percent, adding the most gains to the S&P 500. The sector’s top gainer was consulting firm Accenture PLC, which rose 5.9 percent after it reported quarterly revenue and profit above estimates. The S&P 500 financial index rose ahead of results from the second round of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test for banks and lenders. Financial stocks have been battered recently as the Treasury yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes flattened. Some investors said the financial sector was due to bounce back after its string of losses. “The feeling just was it was overdone,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “We’re seeing a snap-back today, more or less.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.46 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,216.05, the S&P 500 gained 16.68 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,716.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.60 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,503.68. Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 seesawed between gains and losses. Some investors cited caution, given lingering worries regarding U.S. international trade relations, as the end of the quarter approached. “There’s been inconsistency out of the White House as to what the (trade) policy actually is,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “We’re all just waiting and tapping our foot to see the actual policy.” Shares of several drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers fell after Amazon.com Inc said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack. Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business could disrupt major players in the field nationwide, with mail-order pharmacies seen fighting the biggest battles. Amazon shares rose 2.5 percent. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, already under pressure after its third-quarter earnings report, tumbled 9.9 percent after touching a more than 3-1/2-year low. It weighed the most on the Dow, followed by UnitedHealth Group Inc, which fell 1.3 percent. Shares of CVS Health Corp sank 6.1 percent, Rite Aid Corp fell 11.1 percent and Express Scripts Holding Co lost 1.4 percent.  Amazon’s reach was not limited to the health sector. Its plans to entice entrepreneurs to set up their own package-delivery businesses sent shares of United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp skidding 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.  Starbucks Corp dropped 2.6 percent after the company said its chief financial officer, Scott Maw, will retire at the end of November.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 115 new lows.

Both England and Belgium went into the match in Kaliningrad knowing they had qualified for the last 16, but the atmosphere among England fans after the game was more subdued than celebratory. “Dull, boring, lifeless - nothing else to say really. But we’re going to win the World Cup anyway so don’t worry about us!” said Leighton from Liverpool. With both teams qualified, much of the pre-game talk had revolved around speculation a second-place group finish might offer an easier path through the tournament as it avoided a potential clash with Brazil. Fans like Tom, 26, from Milton Keynes chided England, saying they had fielded a weaker side showing eight changes from the team who crushed Panama 6-1. He said the strategy had backfired as the loss meant Gareth Southgate’s side finished second in Group G and face Group H winners Colombia next, rather than Japan who play Belgium. “Absolute disgrace. You play your best team. If it’s not good enough, then so be it,” he said. “We’ve got a harder game now in the last 16. We were too busy being concerned about avoiding Brazil in the quarter-final and now we might not even get there,” he said. The atmosphere among England fans outside the stadium in Kaliningrad was quiet with a few fans chanting “We’re on our way!” Graham Waites, 57, who had travelled to the game from Sweden, was less critical of the performance. “Belgium maybe deserved to win, but nobody was really playing so far because we’d already qualified. But it was disappointing because we want to keep winning to keep building confidence in the team,” he said. He was unsure if England would overcome Colombia. “Who knows, Colombia, sometimes they play brilliant, other times they are disorganised. Hopefully, we will be more organised,” he said.

Senator Bob Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had not satisfied his concerns about the sale to members of a Saudi-led coalition of thousands of precision-guided munitions, or PGMs, which could be used to kill Yemeni civilians.  His position could sink the deal for Raytheon Co, the largest maker of the PGMs in the United States. “I remind you that the American public has a right to insist that the sales of U.S. weapons to foreign governments - especially those of this magnitude and lethality – are consistent with U.S. values and national security objectives,” Menendez said in a letter. “The Congress, as the direct representative of the Americanpublic, is charged with exercising effective oversight of such sales,” he said in the letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. Reuters reported in May that President Donald Trump’s administration had asked Congress to review the sale of more than 120,000 precision-guided munitions to the two U.S. Gulf allies. While the value of the transactions could not be determined, past PGM sales have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more. The Gulf Arab states have been battling since 2015 to restore a government driven out by the Houthis, Shi’ite Muslim fighters that Yemen’s neighbors view as agents of Iran. THOUSANDS DEAD The war has killed more than 10,000 people and created the world’s most urgent humanitarian emergency, with 22 million Yemenis dependent on aid and 8.4 million at risk of starving. Concern in the U.S. Congress, and internationally, has intensified since June 12, when the coalition launched an offensive to drive the Houthis from the port of Hodeidah. Menendez said information the Trump administration hadprovided about the latest PGM sales so far had not adequately addressed bipartisan concerns about whether the weapons would be used to kill civilians. He asked for more briefings, addressing civilian casualties in Yemen, U.S. refueling support for the Saudi-led coalition and a more general U.S. policy in Yemen. Major U.S. arms deals with foreign governments are subject to an informal preliminary review by the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees before a formal 30-day review process in which lawmakers can try to pass legislation barring a sale. While most are approved routinely, some objections have led to deals being canceled, or delayed for months. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican Foreign Relations chairman, blocked major arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf nations for much of last year over a dispute with Qatar, lifting his “hold” only early this year. Trump views weapons sales as an important way to create jobs in the United States and increase the country’s international influence. He could decide to disregard Congress’ objections, but that could galvanize support for any move to pass legislation to block it.

The wholesale retailer sold 37.5 million shares in its IPO, raising net proceeds of $637.5 million which it intends to use to primarily repay debt. The company’s shares opened at $21.25, over its pricing of $17 a share. BJ’s Wholesale Club, which has 215 warehouses spanning 16 states, closely competes with Costco Wholesale (COST.O) and Sam’s Club, a unit of Walmart Inc (WMT.N). The company was taken private by equity firms Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital in 2011 for $2.8 billion. Currently, CVC and Green Equity each own 34.5 percent stake in the company. The Westborough, Massachusetts-headquartered company recorded net sales of $12.50 billion for fiscal year 2018, up 3.3 percent from FY ended 2017. Total net income was $50.3 million, up 13.7 percent from an year earlier. BJ’s IPO will be the second retail listing in 2018 after airport concession operator Hudson Ltd (HUD.N) and comes at a time when brick and mortar retailers are struggling as consumers spend more of their dollars online. Warehouse club operators, however, have largely bucked the downturn as their business models rely more on recurring membership revenues than just top line sales. BJ's Wholesale Club said it had over five million paid members, as of Feb 3. In comparison, Costco had nearly 51 million paid members as of May 13, 2018, according to a filing bit.ly/2KdyvDc with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are leading a 14-firm underwriting syndicate for the retailer’s IPO.

Yet their proud coach Hernan Gomez reacted angrily to a suggestion they were the “worst team” in Russia, insisting 55th-ranked Panama had competed valiantly despite big disadvantages.  “That is a complete lack of respect,” he told a journalist who asked the question first at a news conference minutes after Panama’s third and final defeat to Tunisia 2-1 on Thursday. “You shouldn’t call us the worst team. We are the youngest team with most difficulties. How many pitches do we have? What kind of infrastructure do we have? ... Look at the history of the other countries here ... You should respect our team more.” After heavy 3-0 and 6-1 losses to Belgium and England respectively, Panama took the lead against Tunisia in Saransk, raising the prospect of a first ever World Cup finals win. Yet it was not to be as the North Africans came back in the second half to score twice and take third spot in Group G in a match purely for pride given both teams were already eliminated. “We were much more level in this match than in others,” said Gomez, who insists Panama have learned massively from the experience in Russia and will have a bright future. Asked about his personal future, the Colombian coach said he had been very happy leading Panama but did have other offers and would take his time to consider them.  “Now, I am quite tired as you will understand,” he said.

Oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell and carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler have also made investments in the electric vehicle (EV) market, whose growth is being driven by a shift from polluting fossil fuels. Like its rivals Shell and France’s Total, BP is planning to use its vast global network of filling stations to carve out a position in the EV market, with demand for petrol forecast to peak as early as the end of next decade. “We want to have a leading position in the UK whatever fuel choice our customers have,” Tufan Erginbilgic, head of BP downstream, told Reuters after the company announced the 130 million pound ($170 million) acquisition of Chargemaster. BP forecasts that the global EV fleet will soar to more than 300 million by 2040, from just 1 million in 2016, and said it plans to deploy ultra-fast 150 kilowatt chargers able to deliver 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes across its 1,200 petrol stations in Britain over the next 12 months. Although most EV drivers charge their cars at home or at street charging points, Erginbilgic believes that retail stations will remain essential because only they will offer ultra-fast charging. And as carmakers, battery manufacturers and power providers look for ways to extend the use of EVs beyond urban areas, charging on highways is seen as vital for extending range. “If EVs will be a mass-market product, the world needs to have fast and ultra-fast charging,” Erginbilgic said. Chargemaster, which will be rebranded BP Chargemaster, operates more than 6,500 EV charging points across Britain and has supplied over 50,000 units across Europe.     ROAD TO CHINA   London-based BP plans to invest around $500 million a year in low carbon technology and use its experience in Britain to expand into other rapidly growing markets, first and foremost Germany and China, Erginbilgic said. “China and Germany will definitely be some of the priority markets given the trends… with our ultra-fast charging we can actually enable EV scaling up.” BP announced a partnership in May with China’s NIO Capital to explore investments in EVs, energy infrastructure and battery technology. This followed a joint venture with Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group to develop retail sites across China. “BP sees the future EV retail market evolving into a model similar to today’s where drivers charge their cars in retail sites,” Erginbilgic said. In January, BP invested $5 million in FreeWire Technologies which manufactures mobile EV rapid charging systems. A month later it linked up with car makers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi to develop new battery technology.

ROAD TO CHINA   London-based BP plans to invest around $500 million a year in low carbon technology and use its experience in Britain to expand into other rapidly growing markets, first and foremost Germany and China, Erginbilgic said. “China and Germany will definitely be some of the priority markets given the trends… with our ultra-fast charging we can actually enable EV scaling up.” BP announced a partnership in May with China’s NIO Capital to explore investments in EVs, energy infrastructure and battery technology. This followed a joint venture with Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group to develop retail sites across China. “BP sees the future EV retail market evolving into a model similar to today’s where drivers charge their cars in retail sites,” Erginbilgic said. In January, BP invested $5 million in FreeWire Technologies which manufactures mobile EV rapid charging systems. A month later it linked up with car makers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi to develop new battery technology.

The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday AT&T had agreed to make changes to reduce the likelihood and impact of future 911 outages and improve notifying 911 call centres of outages. AT&T said it has “taken steps to prevent this from happening again.” The FCC said the 911 service outages were the result of planned network changes implemented by AT&T inadvertently interfering with the company’s routing of 911 calls. The FCC said the March 2017 outage lasted about five hours, resulting in the failure of 911 calls from some 12,600 unique users, while the May 2017 outage lasted 47 minutes, resulting in 2,600 failed 911 calls. The FCC said during the March outage the company failed to “quickly, clearly, and fully notify all affected 911 call centres.” AT&T said it had cooperated with the review and agreed that “providing access to emergency 911 services is critically important.” Several other carriers agreed to settlements after an April 2014 outage affected 11 million telephone users. Verizon Communications Inc agreed to a $3.4 million fine after a six-hour 911 outage in April 2014 that affected about 750,000 wireless consumers in nine California counties. CenturyLink Inc agreed to a $16 million settlement in the April 2014 outage. The FCC said the outages at the carriers in April 2014 resulted in 6,600 missed 911 calls about domestic violence, assault, motor vehicle accidents, a heart attack, an overdose, and an intruder breaking into a residence. The April 2014 outage was the result of a preventable software coding error at a call management centre in Colorado, the FCC said. In 2015, T Mobile US Inc agreed to a $17.5 million settlement after two 911 service outages nationwide in August 2014. The separate but related outages lasted approximately three hours and affected almost all of T-Mobile’s then 50 million customers.

French officials announced the initial deal after heated talks on migration at an EU summit in Brussels. But Malta, Spain and the Netherlands, who were initially said to be in favour, later rejected it, according to three diplomats.  An Italian government source said Rome would accept the agreement on migrant centres only if all EU states accepted it and if those centres were set up in several EU states. Now most migrants coming from Africa arrive in Italy. Under the preliminary deal, ‘controlled centres’ would process asylum requests of migrants. A few minutes after the French diplomats reported the  agreement, an Italian government source said Italy would still block an overall deal on migration if it did not include reform of EU asylum rules, known as the Dublin regulation, a sharing of responsibility and costs on rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean and more EU funds for Africa. The complicated talks exposed deep divisions among EU countries on migration, with Italy’s new eurosceptic government threatening to veto agreements on other issues discussed by EU leaders on Thursday if no progress was made on migration.  Europe’s divisions over migration policy have undermined the unity of the European Union, threatened its border-free Schengen area and plunged German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition into turmoil.

Yet their proud coach Hernan Gomez reacted angrily to a suggestion they were the “worst team” in Russia, insisting 55th-ranked Panama had competed valiantly despite big disadvantages.  “That is a complete lack of respect,” he told a journalist who asked the question first at a news conference minutes after Panama’s third and final defeat to Tunisia 2-1 on Thursday. “You shouldn’t call us the worst team. We are the youngest team with most difficulties. How many pitches do we have? What kind of infrastructure do we have? ... Look at the history of the other countries here ... You should respect our team more.” After heavy 3-0 and 6-1 losses to Belgium and England respectively, Panama took the lead against Tunisia in Saransk, raising the prospect of a first ever World Cup finals win. Yet it was not to be as the North Africans came back in the second half to score twice and take third spot in Group G in a match purely for pride given both teams were already eliminated. “We were much more level in this match than in others,” said Gomez, who insists Panama have learned massively from the experience in Russia and will have a bright future. Asked about his personal future, the Colombian coach said he had been very happy leading Panama but did have other offers and would take his time to consider them.  “Now, I am quite tired as you will understand,” he said.

Belgium versus Croatia?  A few months ago such scenarios would have been considered surreal but two weeks into this tournament of surprises, the prospect of lower-ranked nations competing in the sport’s showcase match in Moscow on July 15 has gained more credence. Following Wednesday’s shock exit of four-times champions Germany, the knockout draw could now harbour more surprises than ever before. Add to that the absence of Italy, who have also won four trophies and three-time finalists Netherlands, who both failed to qualify, the round of 16 has an unfamiliar feel to it. The absence of Italy, Germany and Netherlands, who have played in a total of 17 World Cup finals between them, has left a rare void. Yet in the bottom half of the last 16 draw, nations with not a single World Cup triumph to their names like Switzerland, Russia, Sweden, Croatia, Denmark and Colombia have every right to remain hopeful. One of them is likely to make it all the way to the last four or further with Spain, winners in 2010, and England, winners in 1966, as the only established forces in that half of the draw.  The Spaniards take on hosts Russia in their round of 16 game. The Swiss, who in 1954 made it to the last eight for their best performance, face Sweden, whose own best showing — a final — dates back to their home World Cup 60 years ago. Croatia, semi-finalists in 1998 and outstanding so far in Russia, face Denmark while Colombia, who topped their own Group H, play England. The top half of the draw is crowded with almost all the remaining traditional football powers, as twice-world champions Argentina, finalists in 2014, face 1998 champions France. Brazil, five-time winners, take on Mexico, and two-time champions Uruguay battle it out with Cristiano Ronaldo’s European champions Portugal. What is certain for that half is that some former champions will miss out on the last four. With football fans complaining for years about the sport being dominated at both club and international level by only a handful of teams, this World Cup in Russia has certainly enjoyed a gust of fresh air being breathed into its knockout stages. With the World Cup’s second-rank now showing far greater consistency and the quality gap with the title favourites having narrowed, there is a chance for the tournament to shift the global axis of world football like never before.

The patriarch of the musical dynasty that produced the Jackson 5 and solo pop acts Michael, Janet and La Toya Jackson, died almost nine years to the day of Michael Jackson’s June 25, 2009 death from a drug overdose at age 50. Paris Jackson, a model and actress, who with her two brothers was raised by her grandparents after her father’s death, said she would cherish her time with her grandfather “especially our last moments.” “being able to hold your hand, lay with you and cuddle you, give you kisses all over your cheeks and forehead, meant more to me than you’ll ever know. quoting advice you gave me when i was a little kid and seeing your eyes light up, sharing stories my dad used to tell me about you, telling a joke and hearing you laugh for the last time,” she wrote on her Instagram account late on Wednesday. Jackson posted a photo of her holding her grandfather’s  hand, wearing a hospital ID bracelet, as well as pictures of Joe Jackson in his younger days. Father of 11, and with some 30 grandchildren, Joe Jackson was known for verbally and physically abusing his children when training them as singers and dancers. Michael Jackson, who recounted fear and beatings, cut his father out of his will. Despite a history of feuding and rivalries, Paris suggested many of the family rallied around in Joe’s final days. “everyone that came to visit you, came with love, respect, and so much pride in their hearts for you. proud of you, proud to be your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, proud to have your strength and share the dynasty you spent your life creating, and proud to be a jackson,” she wrote. Funeral arrangements have not been announced for Joe Jackson, who died at a hospice in Las Vegas, according to celebrity website TMZ. Janet Jackson, the most successful of the remaining siblings, has not yet commented publicly on her father’s death.

The latest case and another confirmed on June 21 were found to involve health effects similar to those reported by other members of the U.S. Havana diplomatic community and were the first since August 2017, the department said in a statement.   U.S. experts have yet to determine who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in late 2016. Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied any involvement or any knowledge of what was behind it. The State Department statement said the two cases confirmed this month “result from a single occurrence in late May in a diplomatic residence in which both officers were present.” They raised the number of Americans affected to 26, it said. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has partly rolled back a detente with Cuba, first charged diplomats were the victims of “sonic attacks” and Cuba as the host country was at a minimum responsible for their safety. Washington last year sharply reduced U.S. Embassy staff in Havana and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats. Symptoms suffered by those affected have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said. In April, Canada said it would remove families of diplomats posted at its embassy in Cuba as information from medical specialists had raised concerns of a new type of brain injury. The U.S. State Department said this month it had brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concerns they were suffering from a malady that resembles a brain injury.

The technology sector rose 1.1 percent, adding the most gains to the S&P 500. The sector’s top gainer was consulting firm Accenture PLC, which rose 5.9 percent after it reported quarterly revenue and profit above estimates. The S&P 500 financial index rose ahead of results from the second round of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test for banks and lenders. Financial stocks have been battered recently as the Treasury yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes flattened. Some investors said the financial sector was due to bounce back after its string of losses. “The feeling just was it was overdone,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “We’re seeing a snap-back today, more or less.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.46 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,216.05, the S&P 500 gained 16.68 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,716.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.60 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,503.68. Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 seesawed between gains and losses. Some investors cited caution, given lingering worries regarding U.S. international trade relations, as the end of the quarter approached. “There’s been inconsistency out of the White House as to what the (trade) policy actually is,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “We’re all just waiting and tapping our foot to see the actual policy.” Shares of several drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers fell after Amazon.com Inc said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack. Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business could disrupt major players in the field nationwide, with mail-order pharmacies seen fighting the biggest battles. Amazon shares rose 2.5 percent. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, already under pressure after its third-quarter earnings report, tumbled 9.9 percent after touching a more than 3-1/2-year low. It weighed the most on the Dow, followed by UnitedHealth Group Inc, which fell 1.3 percent. Shares of CVS Health Corp sank 6.1 percent, Rite Aid Corp fell 11.1 percent and Express Scripts Holding Co lost 1.4 percent.  Amazon’s reach was not limited to the health sector. Its plans to entice entrepreneurs to set up their own package-delivery businesses sent shares of United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp skidding 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.  Starbucks Corp dropped 2.6 percent after the company said its chief financial officer, Scott Maw, will retire at the end of November.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 115 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.13 billion shares, compared with the 7.28 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

United as a permanent transfer on Thursday. Rooney, 32, signed a 3 1/2-year contract and will fill a designated player spot on the club’s roster. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, though the Washington Post reported it is worth $13 million. Rooney will officially be added to D.C. United’s roster pending receipt of his international transfer certificate when the international transfer window opens July 10, setting up an expected July 14 debut at home against Vancouver — the first game at new Audi Field. He will wear No. 9 after wearing No. 10 for the last 11 seasons. “It is fantastic to be joining D.C. United at such an exciting time in the club’s history with the new stadium opening in just a few weeks,” Rooney said in a statement. “Moving to America and MLS fulfills another career ambition for me. I have the hunger to be a success here and will give D.C. 100 percent — as I have always done for every team I have ever played for.” Rooney still had one year remaining on his contract at Everton, for whom he played from 2002-04 before returning in 2017 after 13 years with Manchester United. However, previous reports have said Rooney felt forced out of Everton — with little choice but to accept joining D.C. United — after being told he is not in Everton manager Marco Silva’s plans. Rooney scored 10 goals in 32 games for Everton during the 2017-18 season, but did not score after December, and his future with the team became cloudy when Silva replaced Sam Allardyce. In total, Rooney scored 208 goals in 491 Premier League appearances and is the second all-time leading scorer behind Alan Shearer (260). “This is a seminal moment for our fans and organization. Wayne is a global soccer icon and his presence at D.C. United will elevate our product on the pitch and soccer as a whole in our city and in this country,” Jason Levien, United managing general partner and CEO, said in a statement. “Wayne has thrived when competing at the most elite levels of soccer and we’re thrilled to have his leadership as we enter this new era at Audi Field.” D.C. United are currently last in the Eastern Conference standings with 10 points (2-6-4), although they have played just two of 11 games at home due to construction of the new stadium. —Field Level Media","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/soccer-usa-dcu-rooney/d-c-united-adds-rooney-on-permanent-transfer-idUKFLMxTQgs","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5e0"},{"title":"U.S. securities regulator unveils proposal to ease ETF approvals","description":"The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.","author":"Katanga Johnson","pubDate":"2018-06-28T20:48:44+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"US,USA,SEC,ETF,Wealth Management,Funds,Personal Investing,Company News,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Exchange,Traded Funds,US Government News,Regulation,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","contentText":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) five-member commission voted 5-0 to propose a rule to allow companies that sell ETFs to launch plain vanilla versions without first seeking approval from the regulator. The SEC said it hopes the rule change will boost competition and innovation by lowering the barriers to entry.  The rule change, subject to feedback from the industry, would apply to open-ended ETFs, a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares it can issue, which covers the vast majority of ETFs today.  Dozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage. ETF issuers must get SEC permission, known as exemptive relief, before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Democratic Commissioner Rob Jackson said he reluctantly voted for the rule change due to potential risk factors to investors, while Commissioner Kara Stein, also a Democrat, emphasized the enforcement of existing oversight controls. “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount - each as of the prior business day,” said Stein. The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group that advocates for regulated funds, including ETFs, applauded the SEC proposal. “Investors - and the asset managers who serve them - deserve a more uniform ETF regulatory framework. The time is right to codify these exemptive orders into a single rule,” the group said in a statement.  Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said the proposed rule change could “support new ETF launches, particularly tied to long-term thematic approaches, from small independent asset managers.” BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group accounted for more than 60 percent of the record inflows of $655 billion that entered ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc. Melissa Garville, a BlackRock spokeswoman, said: “ETFs are driving investor progress by helping tens of millions of people generate wealth and meet retirement goals. That is why BlackRock has long supported regulation of the ETF market that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors.

Carol Rice, assistant inspector general for audit and evaluation, said in a memo published on May 3 this year that her office was reviewing how well the department’s First Responder Network Authority, also known as FirstNet, was carrying out its mandate to create and run a new national emergency responders network. The network, which authorities have been considering since the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, is supposed to provide vast new capacity for communication among emergency officials and crews.   The contract to build and run the network was awarded to AT&T in March 2017, but within communications industry and among emergency responders the contract has generated controversy. Critics have questioned the need for a large new network and also how well other companies’ networks and AT&T’s new network operate together.   The AT&T project is financed by $7 billion (£5.35 billion) from federal government auctions of broadcast spectrum and another $40 billion from AT&T.  The audit aims to determine whether FirstNet “properly administered” a departmental task order covering the deployment, operation and maintenance of the new emergency network, Rice said in her memo. The audit is expected to take about a year.  Government and AT&T officials involved with the contract said the inspector general’s audit was routine. Verizon Communications Inc, the world’s largest wireless telecommunications company and AT&T’s main rival, Verizon did not bid on the contract but has said it has already set aside considerable capacity for emergency use.  At a industry conference in March this year, Mike Maiorana, a Verizon senior vice president, said Verizon covers 400,000 more square miles than AT&T. “And we’re already working with our public-safety customers to build the solutions they need,” he said. In comments to Reuters this week, Maiorana reaffirmed his comments about Verizon’s capacity and its public safety customers.  This week government and AT&T officials told Reuters that the new network’s core is already operational in all U.S. states. AT&T’s contract gives it up to five years to construct further infrastructure for the network, including new towers and hanging new equipment on existing towers. The officials also said this week that one way AT&T will pay for its $40 billion investment is by charging ordinary broadband users for commercial access to the network when it is not being used for emergencies. The new network is designed to rapidly preempt routine traffic to free bandwidth for emergency use, they said. In an email to Reuters on Thursday AT&T said the new network would be fully interoperable with existing networks. “FirstNet is being built on open industry standards,” AT&T said. “So that means first responders on FirstNet will be able to seamlessly communicate with customers on commercial core networks from AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile, and vice versa.” A spokeswoman for FirstNet said: “The FirstNet Core is built on physically separate hardware for a highly secure network. It separates public safety traffic from commercial traffic and provides them an always-on connection with priority and preemption.”    ","siteName":"Reuters","link":"http://UK.reuters.com/article/us-usa-commerce-at-t/u-s-government-watchdog-examines-oversight-of-atts-emergency-broadband-contract-idUKKBN1JO34B","_id":"5b4d829cd165a1540717f5e4"},{"title":"U.S. securities regulator unveils proposal to ease ETF approvals","description":"The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.","author":"Katanga Johnson","pubDate":"2018-06-28T20:48:44+0000","category":"Homepage","keywords":"US,USA,SEC,ETF,Wealth Management,Funds,Personal Investing,Company News,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Exchange,Traded Funds,US Government News,Regulation,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","contentText":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.
