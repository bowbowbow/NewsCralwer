John Rees of the Stop the War group addressed protesters, saying of Trump: \"He's a wrecking ball for race relations, he's a wrecking ball for prosperity, he's a wrecking ball for women's rights, he's a wrecking ball for any peace and justice in this world and we have to stop him.\" \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Mr Trump briefly held Mrs May's hand as they went up the stairs\n                \n            \n            \n        On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base.

He was sentenced in absentia to 10 years last week.He has accused Pakistan's security establishment of conspiring against him ahead of July 25 elections.\"There was a time when we used to say a state within a state, now it's a state above the state,\" he told supporters of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party in London on Wednesday.\n    \n        \n    \n\"Despite seeing the bars of prison in front of my eyes, I am going to Pakistan.\"Thousands of supporters are expected to flock to the airport to greet Mr Sharif, who was convicted by an anti-corruption court last week over his family's ownership of four luxury flats in London.Hundreds of party activists in Lahore are reported to have been detained ahead of his return.He has called for a \"mass gathering of the people\".\nNawaz Sharif - the revolving door prime minister \nBhutto seeks 'progressive Pakistan' votes\nA war of nerves between Pakistan's military and Sharif\nImran Khan in 'new Pakistan' vote pitch\nSharif, 67, has been one of the country's leading politicians for most of the past 30 years. His party has blamed the military for being behind his conviction, saying it is going after the PML-N for its criticism of the security establishment and the party's policy to improve ties with India.In May, the Dawn newspaper published an interview with Sharif in which he questioned the wisdom of \"allowing\" Pakistani militants to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai, referring to attacks in the Indian business capital in 2008.The military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its 70-year post-independence history, has denied it has any \"direct role\" in the elections or the political process.Although he was disqualified from standing in the upcoming election by the Supreme Court, Sharif remains one of the most popular politicians in Pakistan, especially in Punjab, the most populous and electorally significant province.\n            \n            \n        Sharif walks into a jail cellAnalysis by the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad The last time Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to a jail term after a military coup in 1999, he chose to accept a pardon and exile under a Saudi-brokered deal. But this time, he is walking into a jail cell. Back then, it was thought that being the spoilt son of a wealthy father, he was too soft to face the various hardships that can befall a Pakistani politician.But his moves this time underline that he is willing to traverse tougher territory.Sharif may well be contemplating wider protests after the election, which many believe the military has already \"engineered\" enough to ensure his party doesn't win.And he may have made a huge personal sacrifice for this. Sharif has left behind his wife Kulsoom, who has cancer, on life support in a London hospital, knowing that he may not be able to return to be by her side.\n            \n            \n        Last week the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court ordered Sharif to serve 10 years for owning assets beyond his income and one year for not co-operating with the NAB. The sentences are to be served concurrently.His daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, received seven years for abetting a crime and one year for not co-operating - again to run concurrently - while son-in-law Safdar Awan was given a one-year sentence for not co-operating.Sharif and Maryam also received fines of £8m ($10.6m) and £2m respectively. Their lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict but the pair will have to surrender to the NAB before the appeal can be filed.The case, known as the Avenfield Reference, relates to a number of properties in the UK capital.The assault on Pakistan media ahead of voteThe Panama Papers leak in 2015 revealed several of Sharif's children had links to offshore companies, which were allegedly used to channel funds and buy foreign assets - including luxury flats in Avenfield House, on London's Park Lane.His family, however, insist they legitimately acquired the four properties.As part of the ruling, the court ordered they be confiscated for the federal government.\n            \n            \n        Pakistan's general election\nVoters will elect candidates for the 342-seat Pakistan National Assembly\nThe main parties are Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, former cricketer Imran Khan's PTI and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's PPP\nIt will mark the second time that one civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term\nThe run-up to the vote has been marred by what observers say is a crackdown on political activists, journalists and critics of the powerful military \nMore than 371,000 troops will be deployed to protect the election and ensure it is \"free and fair\", the army says \n\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KSQDlV","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207c5"},{"title":"China industrial park explosion kills 19","description":"Huge plumes of smoke were seen at the chemical facility but it is not clear what caused the blast.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-13T04:10:40+01:00","category":"China","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The blast occurred at a plant which makes chemicals for the food and pharmaceutical industries\n                \n            \n            \n        An explosion at an industrial park in China's Sichuan province has left 19 people dead and 12 others injured, officials say.In a statement quoted by Reuters, the authorities in Jiang'an county said the blast happened at a chemical plant run by Yibin Hengda Technology.Photos on Chinese social media showed a huge fire and plumes of smoke rising from the facility.It is not clear what caused the explosion.

Mr Pompeo had said progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang.The date of Mr Kim's letter suggests it may have been sent before Mr Pompeo's visit.What about the planned repatriation meeting?It had been expected on Thursday at the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom.North Korean and US teams, as well as UN officials, had been due to discuss the details of repatriation.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionJames N Butcher was only 17 years old when he volunteered to serve in the Korean war, in 1953\nMr Kim had agreed during the Singapore summit with President Trump to recover \"POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified\".

Similar protests over sex ed have happened around the world.Ontario, Canada's most populous province, introduced a new sex-ed curriculum in 2015 in an attempt to modernise the programme in light of many changes to Canadian society and the growth of social media and sexting. \n    \n        \n    \nThe last time the curriculum had been updated was 1998. In 2005, same-sex marriage was legalised, and in 2012, Ontario passed a law prohibiting discrimination against transgender people. Meanwhile, the explosion of social media and the ubiquity of mobile phone ownership led to the rise of cyber-bullying, cyber-exploitation and sexting.Who objected?Many socially conservative parents said the programme promoted progressive values and usurped their rights as parents to teach their children traditional values about sex and monogamy. Some parents and religious organisations especially objected to parts of the curriculum that taught children about different sexual and gender identities and masturbation.For instance, one lesson plan designed for children around 11 years old suggests describing masturbation as \"something that many people do and find pleasurable\". Other lessons plans for children mention concepts such as sexual orientation, children having two mothers or two fathers, and the idea that not everyone's gender corresponds with their sex at birth.\nIs social media to thank for low teen pregnancy rates?\nSex education to be compulsory in England's schools\nWhat should sex education lessons cover?\n\"The potential for causing serious sexual confusion in the minds of children is very real with this teaching,\" wrote the Campaign for Life Coalition, a Christian anti-abortion organisation. The curriculum also taught children about the importance of consent in sex, and about safety online. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Parents protesting Ontario's 2015 sex ed curriculum\n                \n            \n            \n        Objection did not just come from Catholic and evangelical parents and organisations. Many new Canadians of Middle Eastern and Asian descent also found the curriculum objectionable, and counter to their culture or religion's practices. When the curriculum was first announced, it generated fierce protests in many immigrant communities. In Thorncliffe Park, hundreds of parents staged a \"strike\", pulling their children from school.The issue was complicated by politics and prejudice - the head of the governing Liberal Party at the time, Kathleen Wynn, is a lesbian, and some conservatives parents accused her of \"pushing her agenda\" on families.What's next?Ontario's education minister announced on Thursday that come the autumn, children will be taught the old, 1998 version of the sex-ed curriculum. The move was praised by opponents of the new programme, but denounced by progressives and members of the LGBT community who accused the premier of caving to homophobia.\n    \n        \n            Skip Twitter post  by @teganandsara\n            \n                When we omit crucial information from the curriculum we are in fact asserting that there is something fundamentally wrong with being LGBTQIA2S.

In April, parents across the US kept their children home to protest sex education curriculums in a number of states. They said the curriculums, which varied from state to state, promoted premarital sex and homosexuality. Sex education has long been a hot topic in the US, where only 21 states and the District of Columbia have mandatory curriculums. In contrast, 26 states have laws that require abstinence to be stressed. Teen pregnancy declined by 8% between 2015-16 in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC attributed the decline to a combination of more young people abstaining from sex or using more contraception.Still, the CDC notes that America remains first in developed nations for both STIs and teen pregnancy.Sex education was only made mandatory in England in 2017. In primary schools, children would be taught about building healthy relationships and staying safe, while in secondary school it would focus on sex as well as relationships. The new curriculum also addresses the dangers of sexting, online pornography and sexual harassment.The Safe at School Campaign, run by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, described the announcement as a \"tragedy\".\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KVS1Ve","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207c8"},{"title":"Migrant toddler reunifications 'complete'","description":"But 46 of the 103 detained young children are not eligible to be returned to parents, officials say.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-12T19:17:53+01:00","category":"US & Canada","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionMum and seven-year-old boy reunited after weeks apart\nA majority of migrant children age five and under who were detained under the US immigration \"zero-tolerance\" policy have been reunited with their families.Officials say 57 of the 103 children separated at the US-Mexico border were returned to parents as of Thursday.But 46 children were ineligible for reunification, including some who's parents had already been deported.

Carolyn Bryant (now Donham), was working there while her husband, the shopkeeper, was away. What happened between them is not clear but when her husband returned, he was led to believe that Till had whistled at his wife.Later, Till would be dragged from his bed at his uncle's home and beaten so badly that his face was unrecognisable when the corpse was recovered from the river three days later. The two men known locally to have carried out the attack were acquitted of murder by a jury. The following year, they admitted responsibility in a magazine interview, but said they had done nothing wrong.Till's death sparked massive rallies across the country - including one hosted by a then-unknown Martin Luther King Jr. Rosa Parks later said she had Till in mind during her now famous protest.Till's death is also thought to have played a part in the congressional discussions that led to the 1957 Civil Rights Act, which increased African American voting rights.\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2N6SfVZ","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207ca"},{"title":"Fiat workers strike over Ronaldo signing","description":"Workers at a plant in Italy are to strike after Fiat's owner decided to pay €112m for the footballer.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-12T12:57:29+01:00","category":"Business","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n        Workers at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Italy are to strike after its main investor decided to pay €112m (£99.2m) to sign footballer Cristiano Ronaldo for Juventus.Both the football club and the carmaker are controlled by the Agnelli family through their holding company.For the USB union, the decision means Fiat is missing out on investment.It said the firm needed to guarantee the future of thousands of people, \"rather than enriching only one\".The union added that it was \"unacceptable\" that while Fiat Chrysler workers were making \"huge economic sacrifices\", millions of euros were being spent on the purchase of a player.\n    \n        \n    \nThe four-year deal to woo Ronaldo from Real Madrid was announced on Tuesday amid concern that Juventus might have overpaid for the 33-year-old forward.Is £99m Ronaldo good value for Juventus?However, football finance expert Rob Wilson, of Sheffield Hallam University, said Juventus should earn more than enough money from Ronaldo to cover the transfer fee and his wages.He added: \"The marketing leverage that Juventus will be able to create will be significant.

The key reason for interest in the species is to determine whether this killing is legal or not under Icelandic law. Weighing as much as 200 tonnes and stretching up to 30 metres, blue whales were hunted to the brink by commercial whalers from many countries including the UK from the 1940s to the 1960s when they became a protected stock under the International Whaling Commission.  That means that all countries, including Iceland agreed not to kill the creatures. \n            \n            \n        It's different for fin whales. While there is an international moratorium on killing all whales, Iceland doesn't agree that fin whales are threatened and gives permits for their hunting.  Hybrids between fin and blue whales are a grey area, say specialists. A hybrid allows the whalers to say they simply made a mistake.\"If this is a blue whale, it would be illegal and a breach and there could be fines and perhaps the company might lose their licence to hunt whales,\" said Arne Feuerhahn, from campaign group Hard to Port, which documented the latest killing.What do experts think?From the photographic evidence, most seem to be of the view that it is a blue whale.\"We cannot confirm 100%,\" said Arne Feuerhahn.\"We have consulted a lot of international experts, most think that it is a juvenile male blue whale but there also has been some doubts with some believing that it could be a hybrid between a blue and a fin whale.\" \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    An image showing the fin that experts say is evidence that this is a blue whale\n                \n            \n            \n        Others were more definite. \"From the photos, it has all the characteristics of a blue whale,\" Dr Phillip Clapham, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Alaska Fisheries Science Centre, said in a statement.\"Given that, notably the coloration pattern, there is almost no possibility that an experienced observer would have misidentified it as anything else at sea.\"What do the whalers say?The company involved is certain that the animal it has killed is not a blue whale but a hybrid.\"I am absolutely confident that it's a hybrid,\" said Kristján Loftsson who runs Hvalur hf.\"To mistake a blue whale for a fin whale is impossible, this whale has all the characterisations of a fin whale in the ocean. There are a lot of blue whales off the Iceland coast, when we see the blows and sail to it, and we realise it is a blue and then we leave it and go and look for fin whales.\" What have the Icelandic government said?Kristján Thor Juliusson, Iceland's Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, said: \"While initial information suggests that the animal in question was not a blue whale, we take these reports seriously and the relevant authorities are investigating this matter with all urgency.\"At present, Icelandic authorities are not in a position to confirm the species, although initial information from the directorate of fisheries in Iceland suggests the animal caught is not likely to be a blue whale but rather a hybrid of a fin whale and a blue whale.Campaigners believe that whether it's a blue or a hybrid won't matter that much in the long term as the overall impression in their view is negative. \"These images leave people around the world speechless - thousands come to Iceland to see these animals in the wild and there is just one company who keep this industry alive in Iceland. It really shines a bad light on Iceland's reputation internationally,\" said campaigner Arne Feuerhahn.Will DNA testing be definitive?Yes it's likely that it will be. But there are doubts among campaigners that this will happen swiftly. \"We've been contacting the Icelandic authorities and requested samples,\" said Arne Feuerhahn.\"But it looks right now that they are not really bothered as they have said it could be fall or winter before they get the results of DNA tests.\"The Icelandic government say they are not dragging their feet on this issue.. \"This will only be confirmed once a DNA analysis has been concluded, a process that is being expedited due to the nature of these reports,\" said Minister Kristján Thor Juliusson, Are hybrid blue whales common?Specialists believe that hybrids are not very common in the waters off Iceland. \n            \n            \n        \"Since 1983, they've only recorded five of them,\" said Astrid Fuchs from the charity, Whale and Dolphin Conservation.\"Four of them have been killed by whalers and one is a very beloved whale watching object and is still alive - they are very rare,\" she told BBC News. What will happen to the whale meat?Iceland sells almost all of its whale meat to Japan one of a handful of countries that reject the international consensus to protect whales. However, if this whale is a blue then this meat can't be legally shipped anywhere.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    A Japanese inspector and some of the crew taking pictures of the whale\n                \n            \n            \n        If it turns out to be a hybrid whale, then it is possible that it could be sold in Iceland. However, under the international regulations that govern animal trading, it is the status of the hybrid parents that matter - so if it has blue whale parentage, the Japanese market would be closed. What are the implications for Icelandic whaling?Kristján Loftsson's company has already captured and killed 22 whales including this recent and most controversial one. If it turns out to be a hybrid, then it is likely there won't be major repercussions for the whalers. Mr Loftsson says he is being targeted by campaigners and there is nothing unusual about the recent killing.\"This is nothing new to us, we have had at least five in previous years with similar characteristics and DNA analysis shows a completely different profile from a fin whale and that has been described as a hybrid of a blue and a fin,\" he told BBC News.Campaigners, though, believe it could be the beginning of the end. \"We hope it might be the nail in the coffin of Icelandic whaling,\" said Astrid Fuchs from WDC (Whale and Dolphin Conservation). \"It confirms what scientists have been saying for years, whaling can't be regulated - it is always a bit out of control, they are going out there but they don't know what they are shooting. If this is a blue it would drive home the message that you can't regulate this.\" \n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KU6uB3","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207ce"},{"title":"Papa John's founder resigns over N-word","description":"Papa John's founder John Schnatter has apologised for using the N-word in a conference call.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-12T08:09:08+01:00","category":"Business","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n        Papa John's founder John Schnatter has stepped down as chairman of the company's board after apologising for using the N-word in a conference call.The pizza chain founder used the racial slur in a media training session in May.Mr Schnatter quit as chief executive last year after criticising the NFL over players' national anthem protests.In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it condemned \"racism and any insensitive language\".It later said it had accepted Mr Schnatter's resignation and that a new chairman would be appointed in the coming weeks.\n    \n        \n    \nPapa John's is the world's third-largest pizza chain, with nearly 4,900 outlets worldwide.Role-playing exerciseThe incident happened during a conference call in May between executives at Papa John's and a marketing agency called Laundry Service.According to Forbes, the call involved a role-playing exercise that was supposed to give Mr Schnatter experience in dealing with difficult issues.When discussing how he would distance himself from racist groups, Mr Schnatter said that Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, had never faced criticism for using the N-word, Forbes reported.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Mr Schnatter appears as part of Papa John's branding\n                \n            \n            \n        Trump donor Mr Schnatter stepped down as chief executive of the company in 2017 after he criticised the National Football League (NFL) for not containing national anthem protests at American football games, which he said were hurting his firm's sales.Players had been protesting against the treatment of black people in the US by kneeling during the national anthem.President Donald Trump had also criticised the players for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them.\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2uepOyf","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207cf"},{"title":"Lensman caught in Croatia victory pile","description":"AFP photographer Yuri Cortez was swept off his feet by footballers after Mario Mandzukic's winning goal.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-12T12:11:54+01:00","category":"In Pictures","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Yuri Cortez ended up trapped under the celebrating Croatian players after they beat England\n                \n            \n            \n        No photographer got closer to Croatia's World Cup semi-final victory than AFP's Yuri Cortez who found himself right under the pile of jubilant players.

The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities.\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. \nGuess who's coming to dinner with Trump\nTrump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip\n'Trump Baby' balloon banned from Turnberry\nThe UK-US trade relationship in five charts\nStormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer\nThe pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary.The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort.

They travelled far and wide, and built several resting places - known as sarais - on important routes. Mughalsarai was one such place,\" he said.He added that some people still see Mughals as \"Muslim invaders and not rulers\".\"So I am not surprised that the name change has been politicised.

If the name was to be changed to celebrate a distinguished son of India, it would have been much more appropriate to name Mughalsarai after [former PM] Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was born there and was also a distinguished railway minister.\"On the other hand Deendayal Upadyaya's connection with Mughalsarai is most unfortunate. He fell to his death from a train approaching Mughalsarai Junction.

But scientists studying reefs on tropical islands say the animals directly threaten the survival of these ecosystems. A team working on the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean found that invasive rats on the islands are a \"big problem\" for coral reefs.Rats decimate seabird populations, in turn decimating the volume of bird droppings - a natural reef fertiliser. The findings are published in Nature.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCoral reefs entangled with plastic\nRats and mice cleared from South Georgia\nThe rare event threatening coral reefs\nScientists now advocate eradicating rats from all of the islands to protect these delicate marine habitats.  \n            \n            \n        How do rats harm coral reefs?  The Chagos Archipelago provided a large-scale natural laboratory to answer this question; although the islands are uninhabited by humans, some of them are now home to invasive rats, brought by ships and shipwrecks. Other islands have remained rat-free.   \"The islands with and without rats are like chalk and cheese,\" said lead researcher Prof Nick Graham from Lancaster University. \"The islands with no rats are full of birds, they're noisy, the sky is full and they smell - because the guano the birds are depositing back on the island is very pungent. \"If you step onto an island with rats, there are next to no seabirds.\"By killing seabirds, this study revealed, rats disrupt a healthy ecosystem that depends on the seabird droppings, which fertilise the reefs surrounding the island. On rat-free islands, seabirds including boobies, frigatebirds, noddies, shearwaters and terns travel hundreds of kilometres to feed out in the ocean. When they return to the island, they deposit rich nutrients from the fish they feed on. \"These nutrients are leaching out onto the reef,\" explained Prof Graham. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Seabirds like boobies nest far more abundantly on rat-free islands\n                \n            \n            \n        He and his team were able to track the source of those nutrients back to the fish that seabirds fed on by analysing algae and sponges growing on the reef. \"We also found that fish on the reefs adjacent to islands with seabirds were growing faster and were larger for their age than the fish on reefs next to rat-infested islands,\" Prof Graham explained.There were also significantly more fish on rat-free reefs than on those around \"ratty islands\".  Why does this matter? Coral reefs cover less than 0.1% of the ocean's area, but house about one third of ocean biodiversity. \"Coral reefs are also hugely threatened,\" said Prof Graham. \"So anyone who cares about extinctions and biodiversity needs to care about the future of coral reefs.\"\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Coral reef systems are at \"crisis point\" because of climate change\n                \n            \n            \n        The reefs and their abundance of marine life provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so the decline in coral reefs is poised to become a humanitarian crisis.In an accompanying commentary article Dr Nancy Knowlton, a marine scientist from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, pointed out that, while \"adding rats to the list of dangers faced by reefs might seem discouraging, the discovery of these negative impacts points directly to a specific strategy\" that could slow the ongoing degradation of reefs.That strategy - rat eradication on islands throughout the world - is exactly what the researchers who carried out this study now advocate. \"Coral reef systems are at crisis point because of climate change,\" said Prof Graham. \"And we're desperately trying to find ways to enhance the resilience of coral reefs and allow them to cope with climate change. \"This is one of the clearest examples so far, where eradicating rats will lead to increased numbers of seabirds and this will bolster the coral reef.\"Follow Victoria on Twitter\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2zrMnVg","_id":"5b4851074b9d96f9829207d8"},{"title":"Key questions on Thai cave rescue","description":"Why are the boys in quarantine?

On that Saturday they were scheduled to play a match, which was cancelled, according to head coach Nopparat Kanthawong. He scheduled a training session instead. \n    \n        \n    \nThe boys were keen cyclists so on the Facebook chat group through which they communicated with the parents, coach Ake suggested they cycle to the football field. There was no suggestion there that they would go on to the caves. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the young footballers\n                \n            \n            \n        Saturday was the 16th birthday of Pheeraphat 'Night' Sompiengjai, and a local shop said the boys spent more than 700 baht (US$22) on food to celebrate, a large sum in this area. Coach Nop describes Ake as being very kind-hearted and devoted to the boys. He thinks the boys persuaded him to go with them into the caves. The caves are well-known in the area and had been explored by the boys before. The best guess is they went quite deep, which is easy when they are dry, got caught by rising flood water, and were forced to go even deeper.What kind of communication have the children had with their parents and why are they not being allowed to see them?The official explanation is they are weak from their ordeal and potentially vulnerable to infection. These are now very precious lives in Thailand. A massive effort has been made to get them out alive. The Thai authorities are taking no chances. \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThe boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital\nPerhaps they also wanted to avoid the excitement of seeing their parents again. Thais are generally less physical than westerners. Hugging is unusual. And the parents are from poor, marginal communities, used to being told what to do by officials, and probably grateful for the lengths the government went to in rescuing them. They would not protest. They were allowed to see them through windows, and are gradually being allowed in, wearing gloves and facemasks, to stand in the same room.Will coach Ake face any disciplinary proceedings?At this stage that seems unlikely. The parents say they have forgiven him, and they are grateful for the efforts he is reported to have made to keep their spirits up in the caves, in particular through meditation, which he learned during 12 years as a monk. \nMeet the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave\nHow did the boys survive underground?\nCoach Nop said Ake may be asked to go back to being a monk for a while, something Thais typically do as a kind of penance, or to replenish or cleanse themselves spiritually. Such a move would make a lot of sense to Thais, and he would likely be allowed to resume life as normal after that. Also Thailand typically does not have a 'blame culture', where a culprit must be found for any misadventure. There is a more fatalistic acceptance of things going wrong, less public clamour for accountability.How did they survive so long with so little food, and lose so little weight?The boys were in the caves nine days before they were found. They may have had a little food from what they bought to celebrate Night's birthday. They are passionate football players, very fit, and with the training they have had a tight-knit team. This would have helped them ration their food carefully and support each other, perhaps with songs. \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionChild psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\nCoach Ake taught them to meditate, say Thai navy divers, and gave them more food than he ate. He also told them to drink water dripping from the rocks, rather than polluted ground water. During their last six to eight days they were being fed, initially high-protein gels, but later more normal food, which might have allowed them to start putting on a little weight before coming out.Were they in the dark the whole time?Most of the time. They went in with cheap torches, which would not have lasted long. It is likely they were in the dark for most of the first nine days of their ordeal. Once they were found a Thai army doctor and at least three divers stayed with them, equipped with good torches. Even so they were mostly in the dark, and had to wear sunglasses when they were first brought out.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope\n                \n            \n            \n        Were they sedated in any way?The Thai authorities are being very coy about this. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said they had been lightly sedated. But the BBC has spoken to a number of people involved in the operation who say the boys were heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious. The logic for this would be the fear their rescuers had that they would panic when wearing diving equipment for the first time in darkness and swirling cave water, endangering the lives of all of them.The two British cave divers who led the rescue effort, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, are believed to have asked for Australian Richard Harris, a cave diver and anaesthetician, to assist in preparing the boys. \n            \n            \n        \nHow the Thai boys were rescued\nThe heroes who saved the Wild Boars\nHow they carried semi-conscious or very drowsy boys through the technically challenging early stages of the journey out, with a lot of diving in narrow passages, we do not know. At times they may have been strapped to a diver's body. Later they were strapped on to a stretcher and suspended from a rope pulley system attached to the cave roof. \n            \n            \n        The entire operation was complex, innovative and very bold. Nothing like it has been attempted before. Some of those involved described the tasks undertaken by the core divers, who carried the boys out, as superhuman. Who has paid for this operation?The Thai government, for most of it. It is likely that the contribution by other countries, like the 30 US air force personnel who went to help, would have been funded by their own governments as a gesture of good will. Many Thai businesses supported with transport and food. Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways offered free flights to some of the foreign divers coming in.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers\nCould the Thais have done this on their own?No, and few countries could. Cave diving is a very specialised skill, and expert cave rescuers are even rarer. Thailand was fortunate that an experienced caver Vern Unsworth has explored the Tham Luang cave complex extensively, and lives nearby. He was on the scene the day after the boys disappeared, and suggested that the Thai government needed to invite expert divers from other countries to help. \nThe Brits behind the Thai cave boys search\nAs it happened - Thai cave rescue\nThe Thai navy divers who went down initially struggled, because both their experience and equipment were for sea diving, which is very different. They were driven out of the caves by rapidly rising flood water, and finding the boys seemed a hopeless cause. Once foreign divers arrived, from many different countries, the Thai authorities allowed them to devise first the search, and then the enormously complex rescue. It was a huge logistical operation involving hundreds of people, building guide rope and pulley systems, putting in power and communication cables.

Mary Berry and Newsnight's Emily Maitlis are among eight women to have joined the list.Winkleman was eighth last year but has now dropped to 13th as a result of a shake-up of the corporation's structure.\n    \n        \n    \nShows like Strictly Come Dancing, which are made by BBC Studios, are no longer included on the list because BBC Studios is now considered a commercial entity. The BBC said the published salaries do not yet fully reflect some pay rises and pay cuts, which will not filter through until next year's list.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Last year, Sarah Montague and Emily Maitlis were revealed to earn less than male co-hosts\n                \n            \n            \n        This is the second year that the BBC has published the salaries of its best-paid presenters, although actors, comedians and some hosts have been removed this time as a result of the BBC Studios change.Last year, the top seven were all men and the list sparked an outcry about gender inequality, with some men shown to have been paid more than female co-hosts.There were also complaints about a lack of ethnic diversity. This year, the figures at the top of the list are all white again, although the BBC said the overall number of BAME stars on the list is rising.\nBBC star salaries: See who earned what\nBBC cuts gender pay gap to 7.6%\nSix male BBC presenters agree pay cut\nAmol Rajan on BBC Studios going commercial\nThis year's list includes on-air presenters who earned more than £150,000 in the financial year 2017/18 from news, sport and radio as well as some TV entertainment shows.Director general Tony Hall said the BBC was \"making progress\" and that he wants a 50/50 split on the list as a whole, but that \"these things take time\". The BBC has pledged to close the gap by 2020.But Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey, who is one of the eight women to join the list, told Radio 4's PM programme the pace of change was \"absolutely glacial\".She said: \"There needs to be a proper conversation about why in 2018 we are still fighting the same old battle on equal pay and why the work of women just isn't valued in the same way as the work of men.\"\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Radio 2 said Steve Wright's pay cut will be reflected next year\n                \n            \n            \n        The other new entries include Europe editor Katya Adler and Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague, with Maitlis earning between £220,000-£229,999 to make her the highest new name.Four men have also joined, including BBC media editor Amol Rajan on £200,000-£209,999, which also covers other radio presenting work.Of the 12 people who have moved down the salary bands because their pay has dropped since the previous list, eight are men. But four of the five to have moved up the pay bands are also men.Those moving into a higher salary bracket include Radio 2's Steve Wright and Ken Bruce; Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw; and Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. The only woman to move up a pay band is Sophie Raworth.BBC Radio 2 said: \"Steve has just signed a fresh two year contract with Radio 2 which will show a considerable pay reduction - the BBC annual report is a year behind for him as his old contract had yet to expire.\"\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        Some names have dropped down or been removed from the list since last year because they work for BBC Studios, which has been classed as a commercial entity since April 2017.As part of its latest disclosures, the corporation also published figures for 2018-19 to show it is on the way to rectifying the gender imbalance.Excluding BBC Studios, 59% of on-air figures earning more than £150,000 in the current financial year are men, it said. That compares with 76% in 2016-17.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Claudia Winkleman is still the best-paid woman on the list\n                \n            \n            \n        Lord Hall said: \"I've made it absolutely clear that's not good enough and I want to get to 50/50, and that will mean changes in the range of what people are paid right across [the organisation].\"He added: \"We are making progress and you must understand that. We're trying to get a balanced range of men and women and their pay right across the organisation.Read the BBC annual report in full\"I am concentrating on what is a huge change, which is going from 25% of women to 40% of women being in the top, over £150,000 pay... These things take time.\"The salary details were published in the BBC's latest annual report, and come a week after the corporation said its overall median gender pay gap had reduced from 9.3% to 7.6%.And it comes two weeks after former China editor Carrie Gracie received an apology and back pay from the BBC after discovering on last year's list that she had been paid less than her male counterparts.\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        What happened to Claudia?In last year's report, Claudia Winkleman was the best-paid woman, earning between £450,000-£499,999. This year, she is still the top earning female star, but has slid down the rankings with earnings between £370,000-£379,999.That means the top of this year's list appears more male-dominated than last time.Winkleman's Strictly co-host Tess Daly has dropped off the list all together, as have The One Show's Matt Baker and Casualty's Derek Thompson, among others.That's because most entertainment, factual and drama programmes are made by BBC Studios which, as a commercial entity, no longer has to declare the salaries it pays its staff because it is competing with other production companies.BBC Studios chief creative officer Mark Linsey said: \"We are at a significant disadvantage if we don't have a level playing field. It's a bunfight out there for talent.\"So Claudia's actual earnings will exceed the amount given in this year's annual report. The same can be said for the likes of Graham Norton, Mary Berry and Fiona Bruce, who also make shows for BBC Studios.Top men continue to take cutsThis year's list doesn't fully reflect the pay cuts for some male presenters - and pay rises for some women. In a number of cases, these will be enacted over several years.For example, John Humphrys has seen his published salary drop from £600,000-£649,999 to £400,000-£409,999. But in 2018-19 - which will be shown on next year's list - his pay for the Today programme will be in the £250,000-£299,999 bracket.Similarly, Nicky Campbell and Huw Edwards have also taken pay cuts, which have started to filter through to the list - but are being staggered over a number of years.\n            \n            \n        Meanwhile, the BBC annual report also revealed that the corporation received 48 complaints of sexual harassment and assault in 2017/18.Nine resulted in formal cases or disciplinary action, the BBC said. The remaining 39 did not for a variety of reasons - including the complaint being withdrawn or the individual being complained about no longer working for the BBC.\n            \n            \n        Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The bodies of Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Böhnhardt were found in a burnt-out caravan used in the robbery.\n    \n        \n    \nZschäpe, Mundlos and Böhnhardt had formed a terrorist cell called the National Socialist Underground (NSU). A fire at their home - apparently in an attempt to destroy evidence - led to Zschäpe turning herself in.The NSU's seven-year campaign exposed serious shortcomings in the German state's monitoring of neo-Nazis, and led to a public inquiry into how police failed to discover the murder plot.More than 600 witnesses were heard in the Munich court, making the trial one of the biggest in Germany's post-war history.Four other defendants were also given jail terms for their role in helping the NSU gang:\n\nRalf Wohlleben was sentenced to 10 years for aiding and abetting murder - he procured the silenced gun\n\nCarsten Schultze, a juvenile at the time, was found guilty of handing the gang the pistol and silencer, and was given three years\n\nAndré Eminger was given two years and six months for helping a terrorist group\n\nHolger Gerlach received three years for giving his birth certificate and other ID to Uwe Mundlos\nSpeaking ahead of the verdict, Zschäpe's defence lawyer said she would appeal against any life sentence. During the trial, Zschäpe denied taking part in the murders, saying she only knew of them after they were committed by Mundlos and Böhnhardt.Who were the victims?The NSU case covers 10 murders, two bomb attacks in Cologne, which left more than 20 people injured, and 15 bank robberies.The murder victims were mainly ethnic Turks, shot during their working days with a CZ 83 handgun over the course of seven years. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    German police photos of eight victims: (top, L-R) Enver Simsek, Abdurrahim Ozudogru, Suleyman Taskopru and Habil Kilic and (bottom, L-R) Yunus Turgut, Ismail Yasar, Theodorus Boulgarides and Mehmet Kubasik\n                \n            \n            \n        One Greek victim, Theodoros Boulgarides, was also killed in 2005. The final victim was Michèle Kiesewetter, a German policewoman, who was shot and killed while sitting in a patrol car on her break in 2007. The link between the murders would only be discovered years later.Why were the murders unsolved for years?Police had long suspected that the killers were ethnic Turks in the victims' communities, earning them the nickname the \"Bosphorus\" murders after Istanbul's famous river. The derogatory term \"doner murders\" - in reference to kebabs - was used by some parts of Germany's press.Investigators had thought some of the victims were killed following involvement in criminal activities - allegations that have since been retracted in court.Victims' families, their lawyers and activists have long expressed their frustration at Germany's fragmented policing system, with 16 different jurisdictions for the 16 states.They believe institutional racism hampered the investigation and the trial.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Abdulkerim Simsek (l) and Gamze Kubasik are children of victims murdered by NSU in 2000 and 2006 respectively\n                \n            \n            \n        In particular, they have pointed to the domestic intelligence agency BfV, which destroyed and redacted files related to the terror cell after they became publicly known in 2011 and protected paid informants in the neo-Nazi scene from testifying fully.\nGerman far-right terror attackers jailed\nGirl scout stands up to Neo-Nazi in viral photo\nYouTube's neo-Nazi music problem\nAbdulkerim Simsek was 13 years old when his father, a florist and NSU's first victim, was killed in 2000.

The 43-year-old has spoken just twice during the five-year trial.But while the guilty verdicts will probably be welcomed by the families of the victims, neither these proceedings nor a number of official inquiries have answered fundamental questions. How and why did the killers select their victims?And why did the German authorities - who relied on paid informants from within the neo-Nazi community and stand accused of institutionalised racism - seemingly do so little to protect them?\n            \n            \n        How was the NSU caught?In 2011, an unusual DVD was received by some German press outlets. It showed the iconic cartoon character the Pink Panther in a doctored cartoon, displaying messages from the NSU about the murders, along with spliced footage of the bombings.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The neo-Nazis boasted about the murders in a \"Pink Panther\" confession video\n                \n            \n            \n        On 4 November 2011, Mundlos and Böhnhardt robbed a bank in a German town, one of a string of similar heists. This time, police were able to follow them to a caravan they had hidden in.Despite being armed, the pair did not put up any resistance - and were found dead inside. Investigators believe Mundlos shot Böhnhardt before killing himself.Zschäpe, now the only surviving member of the NSU trio, apparently set fire to the apartment where all three had lived together in Zwickau. She turned herself in a few days later.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The neo-Nazi cell's burnt-out Zwickau home in November 2011\n                \n            \n            \n        The fire damage to her home had not destroyed everything - and investigators found a copy of the Pink Panther DVD, linking the trio to the NSU name and the murders.The suspected murder weapon - the Ceska pistol - was also found in the ruins.The public now knew a neo-Nazi cell had operated with impunity for 11 years, murdering 10 people - and had remained unknown to police.Widespread public outrage followed, along with multiple parliamentary investigations which demanded tighter surveillance of neo-Nazi activities.In July 2015 the German parliament, or Bundestag, passed a set of reforms giving greater power to the BfV to avoid a repeat of the failures in the NSU investigation.It included key changes to the use of paid informants, known as \"V-Leute\".\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2zoMXDc","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f9829207e4"},{"title":"Early rush hour as England expects","description":"Fans are racing home from work to see England meet Croatia in tonight's World Cup semi-final.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-11T17:43:07+01:00","category":"UK","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Pubs, bars, gardens and parks are getting ready to host huge World Cup parties\n                \n            \n            \n        England fans are racing to get home for the World Cup semi-final, making for an earlier rush hour than usual.The RAC said motorways are busy and traffic will peak at 18:00 BST before the roads become \"dead\" by kick-off.Rail travellers say early evening services are \"packed\", especially as some operators have lifted ticket restrictions on peak-time journeys.England play Croatia at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium at 19:00 BST - their first World Cup semi-final in 28 years.\"It's not so much a rush hour as a 'coming home hour',\" said Simon Williams of the RAC, who said the heaviest traffic will be between 16:00 and 18:00.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLive: Build-up to England v Croatia\nReality Check: Do England play better in white or red?\n#WaistcoatWednesday trends ahead of England game\nGareth Southgate's teacher tells all\nThe AA predicted that millions of people will be going home early and, by 19:00, roads will be \"much quieter than on Christmas Day\".Edmund King, president of the AA, said: \"Historically, the biggest TV events and quietest roads in the UK were during the World Cup final in 1966 followed by the funeral of Diana, Apollo 13, royal weddings and Muhammad Ali's 'Rumble in the Jungle'.

Ya' got me, Sacha. Feel better?\"She went on: \"I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick 'humour' of the British 'comedian' Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime.\"\n    \n        \n    \nBaron Cohen series to air on Channel 4Baron Cohen is best known for hoaxing interviewees as comedy characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev and fashion reporter Bruno, all of whom inspired big-screen films.Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said she received a request to contribute to a \"legit historical documentary\" and travelled across the US with one of her daughters.She wrote: \"Baron Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all. \"Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long 'interview' full of Hollywoodism's disrespect and sarcasm - but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen's chagrin.'How dare you'\"The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse.\" Palin, who asked for the proceeds from the programme to be donated to charity, added: \"Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country. Truly sick.\"Last week, the comedian teased his comeback with a preview clip showing former US vice president Dick Cheney apparently agreeing to autograph a \"waterboard kit\" - in reality a plastic water jug.Who is America? will premiere on Showtime in the US on Sunday and the network has promised it will show the comedian and actor \"as you've never seen him before\".

The famous interview saw his character try to pitch a business idea involving an \"ice cream glove\" to the entrepreneur. \nAs part of a sketch for Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show in 1998, Ali G got Conservative politician Rhodes Boyson to say that children should be \"caned\" at school, Baron Cohen was criticised for playing on Boyson's weakness as the politician had previously appeared on Have I Got News For You, apparently without realising it was a satirical comedy show.\nIn an interview with former Conservative politician Neil Hamilton in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton some \"cannabis\", which he accepted and smoked, creating minor controversy in the British media. \nIn 2004, an episode of Da Ali G Show saw Borat interview Republican candidate for US Congress, James Broadwater. Borat's questions led Broadwater to say Jews would go to hell if they did not follow Christianity, which upset some Jewish communities.\nIn the 2009 film of the same name, his character Bruno interviewed Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and in the scene tried and failed to seduce the Texas congressman into making a sex tape with Bruno, a gay Austrian TV host. \n\n            \n            \n        Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) often has no symptoms but can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can leave some women infertile. MG can be missed - and if it is not treated correctly, it can develop resistance to antibiotics.The British Association of Sexual Health and HIV is launching new advice. Its draft guidelines detail how best to spot and treat MG.\n    \n        \n    \nWhat is MG?Mycoplasma genitalium is a bacterium that can cause inflammation of the urethra in men, causing discharge from the penis and making it painful to urinate. In women, it can cause inflammation of the reproductive organs (womb and fallopian tubes) too, causing pain and possibly a fever and some bleeding. You can get it by having unprotected sex with someone who has it. Condoms can prevent this spread.It was first identified in the UK in the 1980s and is thought to affect 1-2% of the general population.MG does not always cause symptoms and will not always need treatment, but it can be missed or mistaken for a different sexually transmitted infection, such as Chlamydia. \nMan has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea\nSyphilis and gonorrhoea up by one-fifth\n'World's worst' super-gonorrhoea man cured\nThe BASHH says this is concerning. Tests for MG have recently been developed but are not available in all clinics yet although doctors can send samples to Public Health England's laboratory to get a diagnostic result. It can be treated with antibiotics - but the infection is developing resistance to some of these drugs. 'I tested positive for MG'John - not his real name - contacted the BBC to tell of his experience of having the infection.\"I was diagnosed with MG last year after meeting my new partner. \"We both sensibly got tested and declared clean at the start of the relationship but GUM [genitourinary medicine] clinics don't test for MG, unless you have symptoms. \"So about a month into the relationship I developed the male symptoms - a sharp burning pain while urinating and a pus-like dishcharge from my urethra - but I had no idea what was wrong. \"After a few weeks I tested positive, while my partner was negative, which didn't make sense. She then got tested again and was positive. \"We were put on antibiotics for two weeks but had no sexual contact for five, to make sure we were clean. After further tests we both tested negative but I still had some small amount of leakage which I was told would go away. It eventually cleared. \"Then out of the blue I got a UTI and symptoms were exactly like MG. \"I am now certain it has returned and I am awaiting further test results. \"The GUM clinic refused to retest my partner as she hasn't shown any symptoms. \"I think clinics should test for MG as part of their sexual health screening process, as this would have been picked up at the start for me.\"'Pack condoms'Eradication rates of MG following treatment with one family of antibiotics, called macrolides, are decreasing globally. Macrolide resistance in the UK is estimated at about 40%, say the guidelines.One particular macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, still works in most cases however.Dr Peter Greenhouse, a sexual consultant in Bristol and BASHH member, urged people to take precautions.\"It's about time the public learned about Mycoplasma genitalium,\" he said.\"It's yet another good reason to pack the condoms for the summer holidays - and actually use them.\"'Out of control'Paddy Horner, who co-wrote the guidelines, said: \"These new guidelines have been developed, because we can't afford to continue with the approach we have followed for the past 15 years as this will undoubtedly lead to a public health emergency with the emergence of MG as a superbug. \"Our guidelines recommend that patients with symptoms are correctly diagnosed using an accurate MG test, treated correctly then followed up to make sure they are cured. \"Resources are urgently needed to ensure that diagnostic and antimicrobial resistance testing is available for women with the condition who are at high risk of infertility. MG - what to look out for\"We are asking the government directly to make this funding available to prevent a public health emergency waiting to happen and which is already spiralling out of control.\"Public Health England says testing is available to diagnose MG and any signs of drug resistance, if necessary.Dr Helen Fifer, consultant microbiologist at Public Health England, welcomed the guidelines, adding: \"If you have symptoms of an STI, we recommend you get tested at your local sexual health clinic. \"Everyone can protect themselves from STIs by consistently and correctly using condoms with new and casual partners.\"\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2zuE7E2","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f9829207e8"},{"title":"Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse","description":"The social media giant failed to ensure Cambridge Analytica deleted users' data, UK watchdog says.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-11T08:18:23+01:00","category":"Technology","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionInformation commissioner Elizabeth Denham says Facebook's fines will damage its reputation\nThe UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook £500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed.The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data.The ICO will also bring a criminal action against Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from \"data brokers\".Specifically it named one company used by the Labour Party, Emma's Diary, which gives medical advice and free baby-themed products to parents.\n    \n        \n    \nFacebook said it would respond to the report \"soon\".The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum, must stop processing UK citizens' data.The fine is modest compared with previous sanctions on Facebook.\nFacebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal\nFacebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs\nCambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs\nIn 2017 it was fined 110m euros (£95m) by the European Commission, which in the same year punished Google for 2.42bn euros (£2.1bn). But information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said companies also worried about reputational damage.The impact of behavioural advertising, when it came to elections, was \"significant\" and called for a code of practice to \"fix the system\", she said.Such a code would ensure that \"elections are fair and people understand how they are being micro-targeted\".The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data following concerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others.The ICO found Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data.While Cambridge Analytica insisted it had indeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others.\"This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,\" said an ICO spokesperson.\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        Lifestyle informationThe ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties telling them to have their data protection practices inspected.It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent.Naming Emma's Diary, the ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Emma's Diary requires users to download an app to get a free bundle of baby-themed goods\n                \n            \n            \n        It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details except that it intended to take some form of regulatory action.The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing told the BBC it did not agree with the ICO's initial findings.\"For over 25 years we have operated with integrity and within the spirit of data regulation,\" said a spokeswoman.\"As the ICO investigation continues we will freely cooperate... and cannot comment further at this stage.\"What else has Facebook been fined for here?Looking wider, the ICO noted Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used.As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of a second breach of the Data Protection Act.Facebook has a chance to respond to the Commissioner's Notice of Intent, after which a final decision will be made.The tech firm's chief privacy officer issued a brief response.\"As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,\" said Erin Egan.\"We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.\"How will Cambridge Analytica be dealt with?Cambridge Analytica, which claimed it could swing elections, and its parent SCL Elections, shut down in May.But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution.The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to an earlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal information it held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    In March, Cambridge Analytica offices were searched by ICO officers\n                \n            \n            \n        Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors.How is AggregateIQ involved?The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign.It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act.The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data.And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds.What else is the regulator doing?Other action includes:\nan investigation into allegations that Arron Banks' Eldon Insurance Services illegally shared customer data with the Leave.EU group he co-founded, and used the business' call centre staff to make calls on behalf of the campaign - claims the firm has previously denied\na probe into the collection and sharing of personal data by the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger In Europe  - and a linked data broker\nan audit of the University of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre. The department carries out its own research into social media profiles.

In the nearby city of Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause.On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica.How did the drama unfold?Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded way the cave complex, blocking their way back out.The story of the rescue - told for childrenThey were found nine days later when two expert British divers entered the cave. The boys were huddled in darkness on a ledge.Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear just how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground.\n            \n            \n        A team of expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system.

The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. How did the boys survive?The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. Officials said the group survived the first nine days of their ordeal by drinking water dripping from the cave walls.They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them.

Rescue teams brought them lights and letters from their parents to help them cope. And their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football.Who are the boys and their coach?Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach.Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates.

The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.Read more about the boys\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2N6MyYe","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f9829207eb"},{"title":"Chinese dissident jailed for 13 years","description":"Qin Yongmin, 64, is a veteran democracy campaigner who was convicted of \"subversion of state power\".","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-11T04:47:01+01:00","category":"China","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Chinese dissident Qin Yongmin, who is now 64, pictured in 1993\n                \n            \n            \n        One of China's highest-profile democracy campaigners has been sentenced to 13 years in prison for \"subversion of state power\".Qin Yongmin, 64, has already spent a total of 22 years behind bars.

The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said there was \"no justification\" for China's retaliation.\"As in the past, the United States is willing to engage in efforts that could lead to a resolution of our concerns about China's unfair trade practices and to China opening its market to US goods and services,\" he said.\"In the meantime, we will remain vigilant in defending the ability of our workers and businesses to compete on a fair and reciprocal basis.\" 'Increasingly worried'Many companies in the US are opposed to the administration's use of tariffs against China, saying they risk hurting business and the economy without being likely to change behaviour.On top of the $34bn worth of tariffs that came into effect on Friday, the White House has said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products. President Trump has suggested these could come into effect later this month.In total, the new import taxes President Trump is threatening to impose are almost equal to the value of China's entire goods exports to the US, worth more than $500bn last year. \"It's a difficult situation for a number of our companies.

However, the competition expired this March, with the $20m grand prize for landing on the Moon unclaimed.  \n    \n        \n    \nDespite the setback, SpaceIL continued developing its spacecraft, which is being built in co-operation with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), a state-owned firm.So far it has spent about $88.5m, much of which it has received from the South African-born Israeli billionaire businessmen Morris Kahn.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The probe will plant an Israeli flag, and then conduct research into the Moon's magnetic field\n                \n            \n            \n        Ido Anteby, CEO of SpaceIL, told a news conference in the Israeli town of Yehud on Tuesday that its probe would be the smallest yet to land on the Moon. It is about 2m (6.6ft) in diameter and 1.5m high, and will weigh only 585kg (1,300lb) at launch. More than 400kg of that weight is fuel that will be burnt off by the time it lands on the Moon.The spacecraft is a \"hopper\", which will land and then take off again with the fuel left in its propulsion system, and then perform another landing 500m away, which was a condition of the XPrize.If successful, SpaceIL's mission will make Israel the fourth country in the world to \"soft land\" a probe on the surface of the Moon - after the former Soviet Union, the United States and China.\n    \n        \n            Skip Youtube post  by SpaceIL\n            \n            Warning: Third party content may contain adverts\n            Report\n            End of Youtube post  by SpaceIL\n        \n    \n    \n        <div class=\"embed-image-wrap\" style=\"max-width: 500px\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJ5HsgHhxQ\">\n                <figure class=\"media-landscape full-width embed-screenshot-nonejs\">\n                    <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                         <img class=\"js-image-replace\" alt=\"Youtube post by SpaceIL: SpaceIL Landing Plan\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/socialembed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJ5HsgHhxQ~/news/world-middle-east-44777305\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\">\n                        <span class=\"off-screen\">Image Copyright SpaceIL</span>\n                        <span class=\"story-image-copyright\" aria-hidden=\"true\">SpaceIL</span>\n                    </span>\n                    <div class=\"embed-report\"><a class=\"embed-report-link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/contact-us/editorial\" aria-label=\"Report Youtube post by SpaceIL\">Report</a></div>\n                </figure>\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    \n\n\nMr Kahn said he hoped the mission would create an \"Apollo effect\" for the next generation in Israel - a reference to the enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering and maths triggered by Neil Armstrong's Moon walk in 1969.\"This is a tremendous project,\" he added. \"When the rocket is launched into space, we will all remember where we were when Israel landed on the Moon.\"Ofer Doron, head of IAI's space division, said Israel was \"going to show the way for the rest of the world\" to send a spacecraft to the Moon at a reasonable cost.\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KO18He","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f9829207f2"},{"title":"PayPal: Your death has breached our rules","description":"Payments firm apologises after writing \"insensitive\" letter to cancer victim about her debt.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-10T17:11:33+01:00","category":"Technology","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    This photo of Lindsay and Howard Durdle was taken last year\n                \n            \n            \n        PayPal wrote to a woman who had died of cancer saying her death had breached its rules and that it might take legal action as a consequence.The firm has since acknowledged that the letter was \"insensitive\", apologised to her widower, and begun an inquiry into how it came to be sent.The matter came to light after her bereaved husband contacted the BBC.He said he wanted to make other organisations aware how distressing automated messages could be.Lindsay Durdle died on 31 May aged 37. \n    \n        \n    \nShe had been first diagnosed with breast cancer about a year-and-a-half earlier.

After the last boys and their coach were rescued on Tuesday, we look back at how the story unfolded. On Saturday 23 June, 12 members of the Wild Boar soccer team, aged 11-16, entered the Tham Luang cave system in Thailand's Chiang Rai Province along with their 25-year-old football coach after a team practice. The cave system, which is 10km (6 miles) deep, is known locally for its deep recesses and narrow passages. The team has reportedly visited the cave before - but this time heavy rains cause flooding, impeding their exit. After the children fail to return home, they are reported missing and search efforts begin. Initial rescuers at the site reportedly find the team's bicycles, football boots and other belongings close to the cave's entrance. \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        Media and volunteers start to gather at the site as heavy rain continues to complicate the search and rescue process. \nWho are the boys trapped in the cave?\nHow the boys were saved\nThe brits who helped find the boys \nBy Sunday family members reach the cave, praying and holding vigils for the missing children. \n            \n            \n        Three days in, divers from the Royal Thai Navy arrive to assist in local search efforts.Fresh hand and footprints are spotted inside the vast cave complex, raising hopes for the group's safety.Government officials visit the site, and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon says the government is still optimistic the team can be found alive.

Family members and officers are pictured fainting, and desperation deepens as weather conditions deteriorate.Thailand is now captivated by the desperate search, clinging to hope they can survive.

The US president has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March 2019.Asked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. \"It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,\" he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. \"We will work it out and all countries will be happy.\"So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil.\"Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday \"may be the easiest of all\". Asked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. \"I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me.\"\nTrump's plans for his UK visit revealed\nTrump told to appreciate European allies\nTrump visit to put 'pressure' on police\nAs for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a \"friend of mine\" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit.\"He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him.\"\n            \n            \n        The ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the \"Brexit dream was dying\", has spoken of his \"increasing admiration\" for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. Asked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a \"positive impression\".He said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington.  The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. During his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK will be a \"dependable ally\"\n                \n            \n            \n        Protests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. Mrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him.After being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a \"dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world\".Mr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no \"hard border\" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough.\"If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,\" he told the Irish Parliament. \"I think perhaps we are now entering into that space.\"And speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a \"very ambitious\" free trade deal with the UK. The Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence.Mr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to \"protect\" Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. The US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets.  \n    \n      \n          \n          Report\n      \n      \n          <figure class=\"media-landscape full-width embed-screenshot-nonejs\">\n              <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                  <img alt=\"Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump: Getting ready to leave for Europe.

How can that be the case?That workers with six-figure salaries could be considered \"poor\" is something that might surprise many people.But taking into account income and housing costs that is the reality for some families - who may be eligible for housing assistance - according to a recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.In San Francisco and nearby San Mateo and Marin Counties it said $117,400 for a family of four was \"low income\", while $73,300 (£54,900) was \"very low income\" - the highest figures anywhere in the country.A look at how earnings vary across the US and between jobs illustrates what is going in the city and the country as a whole - factors explored by a new study and interactive website by The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.\n    \n        \n    \nBelow the poverty line\n            \n            \n        Nearly two thirds of American families of four live on less than San Francisco's \"low-income\" threshold of $117,400. Across the US, the median (middle) household income for a family of four is $91,000 (£68,170). For a family of any size, the figure is $59,000 (£44,180). (Median incomes are used throughout this piece).And, in a country of 326m, more than 40m people in families of all sizes live below the poverty line, which is $25,100 (£18,800) for a family of four. Looking at all jobs, earnings are much higher in some large cities than they are in the rest of the country. \n            \n            \n        San Francisco in particular stands out.The city has become a hub for IT and other high-tech industry - leading to an economic boom which has seen it become home to many of the country's highest-paid workers. Between 2008 and 2016, individual earnings for full-time workers aged 25 to 64 in the San Francisco metro area, which also includes Alameda and Contra Costa counties, grew by 26% - far faster than in many other large metro areas. By 2016, earnings had risen to $63,000 (£47,200)Of course, there are other areas of the US with high wages.Among 25 to 64-year-olds, typical earnings for full-time workers in recent years were $65,000 (£48,670) in San Jose, $60,600 (£45,400) in Washington DC and $55,700 (£41,700) in Boston.\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        In high-earning places like these there are many jobs that pay well. In San Francisco, doctors - the highest-paid occupation - can expect to earn $193,400 (£144,800). The typical chief executive or public administrator is paid $167,300 (£125,260), while software developers can expect $117,100 (£87,670).But there are plenty of people earning much less.The lowest-paid people in San Francisco are farm workers, who typically earn $18,500 (£13,850), while childcare workers earn $22,300 (£16,700).Wages in other big US cities are noticeably lower.In Detroit, for example, a doctor typically earns $144,300 (£108,000), while childcare workers receive only $15,000 (£11,230).  However, the wide variation in earnings is only part of the equation.Living costs, particularly for housing, play a significant role in determining how far workers can stretch their earnings.In fact, living costs in general for the San Francisco area are 25% higher than the national average.However, as earnings are 45% higher than for the nation as a whole, many people in San Francisco are still coming out ahead.\n            \n            \n        More like this\nWho are the poor Americans?\nWhy are black poor Americans more optimistic than white ones?\nThe UK's rapid return to city centre living\nThe UK towns and cities with the highest and lowest wages \n\n            \n            \n        It is when we look at housing costs specifically that the comparison is less favourable.In many large cities, the problems of high rents and home prices have been exacerbated by strict building rules and growing income inequality.It is high rents in San Francisco that are behind the decision to label some six-figure earning families as \"low income\".For example, a fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco area is considered to be $3,121 (£2,340) per month - nearly twice the 2008 figure of $1,592 (£1,190). In Cincinnati, Ohio, the figure is $845 (£632). This difference (270%) is much larger than the difference in median family incomes (50%).\n            \n            \n        As such, affordability is a significant challenge for many people in San Francisco.Across the US, the government typically defines a low-income family as one that earns less than 80% of the median income for families of the same size, in the same area.But in places with unusually high housing costs the threshold can be higher.In San Francisco, high rents have driven the government's \"low income\" threshold of $117,400 (£87,970) almost as high as the median income for a family of four in the area - $118,400 (£88,630).While falling below this mark does not automatically entitle families to government housing assistance such as subsidies and public housing, it is a factor that is considered. More important than moneyBut it is of course worth considering that, for many people, high prices are something that they are willing to put up with for a good quality of life.San Francisco is certainly an expensive place to live, but good weather and a rich cultural life attract many residents.Across the US, it is often the case that the places rated most highly for quality of life - like San Francisco and Santa Barbara in California and Honolulu in Hawaii - tend to have a high cost of living.While families with six-figure earnings may not be \"low-income\" in the broadest sense, the challenge remains for expensive cities across the US to find ways to offer a good quality of life to all of their residents.A critical look at how to make more affordable housing available might be an obvious place to start.\n            \n            \n        About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.Prof Jay Shambaugh is the director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.Ryan Nunn is the policy director of The Hamilton Project and a fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.The Brookings Institution is a not-for-profit public policy organisation, conducting research that leads to new ideas for solving problems facing society.\n            \n            \n        Edited by Duncan Walker. \n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KIPygC","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f9829207ff"},{"title":"George Clooney injured in motorbike crash","description":"A representative for the actor said he was \"recovering at his home\" in Sardinia \"and will be fine\".","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-10T16:59:38+01:00","category":"Entertainment & Arts","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The star is filming six-part drama Catch 22\n                \n            \n            \n        Hollywood star George Clooney was taken to hospital after suffering minor injuries in a collision involving his motorbike and a car.The accident happened in Sardinia where the US actor is filming his latest TV series, Catch-22.A representative for the actor, 57, said he was treated and released from a hospital in the Sardinian city of Olbia.\"He is recovering at his home and will be fine,\" the spokesperson continued.\"At 8.15am George Clooney was riding his scooter on the State Road 125 towards Olbia from Puntaldia,\" said a spokesman for the Italian Carabinieri in a statement.\n    \n        \n    \n\"A car (a Mercedes E SW) did not respect the right of way and hit him.

Starbucks' pushback against plastic has drawn a mixed reaction. M Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, issued a statement saying that 500m plastic straws are thrown away every day in the US and lauded Starbucks for its \"meaningful action to protect our oceans\".

Others voiced concern for those who rely on straws due to disability. \"What about disabled people who rely on straws? I often can't drink or eat without them,\" a customer tweeted.

The anti-straw movement has concentrated on the destruction of marine life caused by plastics.A July 2017 paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes. Of this figure, 6.3bn tonnes are now waste and 79% has accumulated in landfills or the natural environment.  Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problemAn estimated 10m tonnes of this plastic currently ends up in the oceans every year. But despite rising popularity of the straw-banning trend, it is unclear how much straws specifically should be blamed for marine pollution.  Scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox examined trash collected on US coastlines over five years to estimate that there are almost 7.5m plastic straws lining the country's beaches.This figure is eclipsed, however, by the nearly 9m tonnes of plastic that end up in oceans and coastlines all over the world, according to a study published by University of Georgia professor Jenna Jambeck in the journal Science. Still, plastic bans are gaining momentum. Starbucks has joined a growing list of companies, like the White Sox, Alaska Airlines, and the BBC to institute plastic-curbing policies. \n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2u7tQIW","_id":"5b4851084b9d96f982920804"},{"title":"PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil","description":"Theresa May warns her party it must unite after a string of resignations over Brexit forced a reshuffle.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-10T16:04:18+01:00","category":"UK Politics","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Theresa May tweeted a picture of the cabinet, saying it had been a \"productive\" meeting\n                \n            \n            \n        Theresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis.Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit.The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power.Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be \"four square\" behind her.After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was \"looking ahead to a busy week\".\n    \n        \n    \nUS President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in \"turmoil\" and \"it is up to the people\" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister.\nLive updates: Brexit resignations reaction\nLaura Kuenssberg: Could it be opportunity for PM? \nKatya Adler: The view from Brussels on UK turmoil\nTrump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that.The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take.Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals.Why Johnson and Davis quitLast Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a \"collective\" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK.However, Mr Johnson -

Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done.None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as \"caver's disease\", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely.The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave.They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light.\n            \n            \n        How are the rescued boys?The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June\n                \n            \n            \n        Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered.\"All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,\" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The boys are currently being treated at the Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital\n                \n            \n            \n        Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food.

The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.Wearing a full-face mask, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. \nThe operation in pictures \n'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'\nLetters of love from trapped Thai boys\nThe toughest part is about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n            \n            \n        In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday.

Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was \"based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong\".He did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case \"as precedents we must follow\".Executive powerMr Kavanaugh argued in 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump while the president before his term is up.GunsHe is pro-second amendment. In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection.The environmentThe nomination is likely to concern environmentalists. Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases. \n            \n            \n        What's at stake?The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government.It rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights, immigration policy, campaign finance and racial bias in policing.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionExplaining Roe v Wade and abortion in US\nEach of the nine justices holds a lifetime appointment. As Mr Kavanaugh is relatively young, he could serve for decades to come.His appointment will not change the ideological tilt of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but he could shift the bench further to the right.Justice Kennedy sometimes sided with the court's liberal members. But Mr Kavanaugh may not be so accommodating.Neil Gorsuch, 50, who was appointed by Mr Trump last year, is already one of the court's most conservative justices.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Judge Kavanaugh was accompanied by his wife and two daughters\n                \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        A safe pair of handsAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonThe front-runner was a front-runner for a reason. Over the weekend, it looked as though Judge Kavanaugh's star may have been fading, that perhaps he had too-close ties to the Bush family for Mr Trump's liking. In the end, however, the safe pick won out.He is the kind of judge a President Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney would have picked - a man with an established legal pedigree and a reputation as a reliably conservative jurist. If the party sticks together, the president's choice will be sitting on the Supreme Court when its new term starts in October.President Trump campaigned with a promise to conservatives that he would fill the federal courts, from the top on down, with judges to their liking. It's a promise that has helped cement near-record levels of support for his presidency from Republican voters - and for good reason. Mr Trump is securing a conservative judiciary for a generation.   \n            \n            \n        What next?The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate, which the Republicans narrowly control 51-49.A nominee needs a simple majority of 51 votes to be confirmed. With Senator John McCain battling cancer, Republicans can currently only muster 50 votes. Before a full vote in the chamber, the prospective justice will be grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings that can go on for days.The White House and Republicans want the nomination confirmed by November's mid-term elections.Conservative activists will begin running ads pressuring politically vulnerable Democratic senators to vote for confirmation.Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia will be prime targets, as they face tough re-election campaigns in their conservative states this year. Meanwhile, liberal groups are calling on two moderate Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - to reject the nominee.Ms Collins has said she will not vote for any candidate who threatens abortion rights.\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2u6pFgf","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503b8a"},{"title":"Divers push to complete Thai cave rescue","description":"A ninth boy emerges as divers push to complete the rescue of a football team from a flooded cave.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-10T12:29:56+01:00","category":"Asia","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionRescue diver in Thai cave: \"I was very scared\"\nNineteen divers have entered the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand on a gruelling, hazardous mission to rescue those people still trapped inside.They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more.If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death.

Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as \"caver's disease\", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely.The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave.They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again.

The world's biggest berg, a block of ice a quarter the size of Wales, fell off the Antarctic exactly a year ago. But what then? We've gone back to find out. Weighing a trillion tonnes and covering an area of nearly 6,000 sq km, the colossus dubbed A-68 has kind of spent the past 12 months shuffling on the spot - rather like a driver trying to get themselves out of a tight parking spot at the supermarket. Occasionally, the berg head-butted the floating shelf of ice from which it calved, but made only limited progress in moving north - its expected path out of the Antarctic's Weddell Sea towards the Atlantic Ocean. \"An iceberg as massive as A-68 is sluggish, and thus needs time to accelerate,\" explains Thomas Rackow from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute. \"Compared to much smaller icebergs, A-68 is also less sensitive to offshore winds that could potentially drive the iceberg away from the continent. In fact, since the calving event in early July last year, we could see the iceberg going back and forth due to the prevailing winds.\"\n    \n        \n    \n\n'Buy a trinket, condemn an elephant'\nFossil of 'first giant' discovered \nKrill companies cut Antarctic fishing\nDr Rackow says the frozen ocean surface probably also played some role in constraining the berg's movement, and wonders if the underside of the berg was catching on the seafloor. It's a thought shared by Suzanne Bevan at Swansea University, UK. \"We know so little about the bathymetry (depth) in that area of the Weddell Sea,\" she told BBC News. Given time, though, A-68 should pick up the pace as the currents grab hold of it.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionAntarctic scientist Ella Gilbert's video of giant iceberg A-68\nAnd A-68 hasn't melted?Nope. It's extremely cold in that part of the world. The berg has knocked off some of its sharp edges, but it remains much as it was - 150km long and 55km wide. Two largish chunks have detached, one of them sufficiently big to get its own designation (A-68b) in the list of giant bergs kept by the US National Ice Center. The American agency has officially now put A-68 at number six in its all-time ranking. If you were wondering - a berg called B15 is the historic champ. It was roughly 11,000 sq km in area when it broke away from Antarctica back in 2000. And it's still going, albeit in pieces. Astronauts on the space station recently photographed the largest remaining fragment of B15 passing the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia on its way to the equator. A-68 will very probably travel this same \"iceberg alley\".\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Eighteen years on, B-15 is now a shadow of its former self\n                \n            \n            \n        What's A-68 like if you go there?Ella Gilbert from the British Antarctic Survey was the first to make a movie of the berg from close quarters. The scientist was in a small plane gathering atmospheric data when she made a low pass along its edge. \"It took us an hour and a half to go from one side to the other,\" she says. \"It's scale is mind-boggling, fascinating - it's like another world. It was possibly the most exciting thing I've ever done.\" Ella is often asked why the berg broke away. \"It's complicated,\" she explains. \"The region is clearly undergoing a lot of change but you can't just say 'it was the climate'. Iceberg calving is a natural process anyway. If you put more snow in at one end, it has to come out the other end as icebergs.\"\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Ultimately, it's expected A-68 will enter \"iceberg alley\" into the Atlantic\n                \n            \n            \n        So, why should we be interested?A-68 broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf - the floating extension of glaciers running off the Antarctic Peninsula. The shelf is the subject of intense scrutiny because similar structures to the north have disintegrated. Climate warming very probably was implicated in some of these losses, and so it is inevitable that people will ask what the future holds for Larsen C. It is one of the biggest ice shelves in all of Antarctica and its collapse would allow its feeding glaciers to dump more of their ice into the ocean, raising sea-levels.  \n            \n            \n        How likely is that to happen?The answer to this question will only come with ongoing monitoring. The first thing scientists want to understand is how the shelf will react to calving such a big berg. The stresses acting on the shelf will almost certainly have changed. \"The models tell us we should expect the centre of the Larsen C Ice Shelf to speed up a bit, and the edges, where the berg was attached, to slow down,\" says Swansea's Adrian Luckman, whose Midas research group was most closely involved in monitoring A-68's break-away. But this behaviour is very difficult to demonstrate because tidal movements push on the shelf and complicate the satellite measurements.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    A-68 should pick up the pace as the currents grab hold of it\n                \n            \n            \n        Tell me about a surprising discoveryScientists have established that the surface of the Larsen C Ice Shelf can melt even during the deep freeze of permanent night in the Antarctic winter. Weather station and satellite observations have established that a particular type of warm westerly wind, or Foehn, will flow down off the peninsula mountains to produce ponds on the surface of the shelf. \"You see this in May, which in the Antarctic is equivalent to late November. Forty percent of the melt in 2016 occurred in this winter period - all because of the Foehn effect,\" says Adrian Luckman. This is a process scientists will need to watch closely. Some of those northern shelves that collapsed were destabilised by the presence of large numbers of meltwater lakes on their surface. Larsen C is far from replicating such conditions but that may change in the coming decades if global warming progresses as expected and its effects impinge deeper into the Antarctic.Antarctica's troublesome 'hairdryer winds'\n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The drift paths (red lines) of countless bergs have been tracked around the Antarctic continent (black).

The new version was made by the Queen's dresser, Angela Kelly.  According to tradition, water from the River Jordan was used at the christening. Following the 40-minute traditional religious service, guests attended a private tea which included slices of christening cake, from a tier taken from the duke and duchess' wedding cake.

His daughter, Florence, was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's royal wedding in May.Lady Laura Meade: Also one of Princess Charlotte's godparents, Lady Laura is the wife of Prince William's close friend and fellow Etonian James Meade, known as \"Meadey\".

Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary Conor Burn has also stepped down. Brexit minister Steve Baker also left the government.Housing minister Dominic Raab has replaced Mr Davis as Brexit secretary.What Johnson says in his resignation letterMr Johnson does not pull any punches, saying Brexit \"should be about opportunity and hope\" and a \"chance to do things differently\", but \"that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt\".He claims crucial decisions have been postponed, including preparations for a \"no-deal\" scenario, \"with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system\". Boris Johnson's resignation letter in fullThe PM's response to JohnsonIn her letter accepting his resignation, the prime minister said she had allowed cabinet ministers \"considerable latitude to express their individual views\" on Brexit.\"But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.\"What prompted the row?The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.There have been differences within the Conservatives over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people.Mrs May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. She took her entire cabinet to her country residence on Friday to try to get agreement on a UK vision for post-Brexit relations. An agreement was announced after the 12-hour meeting, but many Brexiteers have been unhappy with the deal which they think will lead to the \"worst of both worlds\". \nRead Laura's full blog on Boris Johnson resigning\nProfile: Boris Johnson\nWhy did David Davis resign?\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionDavid Davis explains why he resigned\nThe man leading the UK's negotiating team, David Davis, resigned late on Sunday night, saying that he did not agree with the UK's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them.He told the BBC that he thought the UK was giving away \"too much, too easily\" and predicted that the EU would be demanding more concessions in talks.Mr Davis, who had been Brexit secretary since Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, said he had made compromises since taking on the role, but this was \"one compromise too far\".Theresa May is sticking by her Brexit planSpeaking in a boisterous House of Commons, Mrs May defended the Brexit plan agreed on Friday, which would see the UK agreeing a \"common rulebook\" with the EU for trading in goods, but not services, after Brexit.At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planShe paid tribute to Mr Johnson's \"passion\" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation.

Under her proposal, a treaty would be signed committing the UK to \"continued harmonisation\" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland.But Parliament would oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to \"choose\" to diverge from the EU rules. Freedom of movement would come to an end but a \"mobility framework\" would ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to study and work in each other's territories.\nReality Check: What's the EU common rulebook?\nBrexit: All you need to know\nWhat was the reaction in the Commons?Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a \"sinking ship\", shattering the \"illusion of unity\" initially surrounding the Chequers plan.There was a crisis in government, he said, adding: \"It is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain.\" \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThe PM's recent comments about restored \"cabinet responsibility\" drew laughs in the House of Commons.\nMrs May came under pressure from prominent Tory Brexiteers on the backbenches, with ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urging her to rule out further concessions during the talks.What has been the reaction from the EU?The European Commission declined to comment on the resignations but Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said he hoped a change in faces might lead to a change in policy. \n    \n      \n          \n          Report\n      \n      \n          <figure class=\"media-landscape full-width embed-screenshot-nonejs\">\n              <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                  <img alt=\"Twitter post by @eucopresident: Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain.

The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health.\nWho are the Thai boys trapped in a cave?\nHow risky is the Thai boys rescue?\nThe rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing.The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days\n                \n            \n            \n        After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: \"All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe.\"He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined.Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was.The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials.\n            \n            \n        'Daring to believe'By Martin Patience, Chiang RaiOutside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence.Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan.A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday.Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama.It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys.The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive.\n            \n            \n        How are the boys being moved?A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionChild psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\nGetting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. \nThe operation in pictures \n'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'\nLetters of love from trapped Thai boys\nThe process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. \n            \n            \n        The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n            \n            \n        In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.He lost consciousness and could not be revived.

Aptamil recently changed the recipe of three of its baby milk formulas. Hundreds of parents in the UK have complained on social media that the revised formula milk is making their babies sick.Danone said it had carried out extensive safety checks, but added that it was \"taking all feedback very seriously\".

Danone UK said: \"We would like to reassure parents that the quality and safety of our products is our number one priority.  We have recently introduced new Aptamil formulations and we recognise that some families have not found the transition to the new formula easy.   \"We have undertaken extensive quality and safety checks, including clinical trials, product testing and product experience tests on these products.  The results have shown that babies take to this formula well and that it is safe.\"We have updated the mixing instructions on our packs as this new formula requires parents to mix it up slightly differently, compared to the previous formulation - specifically, shaking vigorously for 10 seconds to dissolve the powder.\"Aptamil said it had changed the recipes of three products: Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1), Aptamil Follow On Milk powder (stage 2) and Aptamil Growing Up Milk powders (stages 3 & 4). 'Scientific research'When asked why the baby milk formula was changed, Danone did not immediately reply.Rebecca Heal in Larkfield, Kent, told the BBC that she complained to Aptamil about the new recipe and smaller packaging, and was told that the formula was changed because of \"scientific research and costs to cover that\".\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Rebecca Heal and her daughter Olivia\n                \n            \n            \n        Ms Heal, who has a three-month-old daughter Olivia, said that she tried to follow Danone's new mixing instructions, but the milk still wasn't right.\"It took a lot of effort and shaking to get it to mix properly,\" she said.\"Even after a minute or so of vigorous shaking, the milk still had gritty residue on the sides of the bottle, but just increased the amount of froth on the top as a result.\"However, some parents using the revised formula posted on Aptamil's Facebook page that they had not experienced any problems.One mother, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that her four-month-old baby had successfully transitioned from breast milk to Aptamil First Infant Milk.\"There is some residue after mixing, but then I found this was was often the case with the old formula anyway,\" she said. \"Coming from a science background, I'd rather look at things analytically, than just jumping on hysteria.\"\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Courtney Wheeldon and her son Jenson\n                \n            \n            \n        Courtney Wheeldon, based in Hull, said that her 17-week-old son Jenson, who was born prematurely, had benefited from being on the new revised formula.\"My son appears a lot more content and happy... he's putting on a lot more much-needed weight,\" she told the BBC.\"My only complaint about the new formula would be that there is 100g less in the tubs for the exact same price.\"\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2zoMBMW","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503b95"},{"title":"Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?","description":"The ordeal faced by the football team and their coach trapped in a Thai cave has gripped the world.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-11T11:49:53+01:00","category":"Asia","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The 12 boys were all rescued and taken to hospital\n                \n            \n            \n        On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand.

Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? \"I don't think so,\" he said.That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either.Some former Remainers say \"look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in\".From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get \"look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly\".Read more from Laura's blogMrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position.Mr Raab has served in government since after the 2015 election, initially working in the Ministry of Justice before moving to the communities department in January.The European Commission has declined to comment on the change of personnel, saying it would continue to negotiate with \"goodwill\" to try and secure an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit and future relations.Asked how much of a problem Mr Davis's resignation was for the future of the negotiations, a spokesman replied: \"It is not for us, we are here to work.\" \nAt-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan\nBrexit: All you need to know\nMr Davis said he could not remain in his post because he no longer believed in the plan for the UK's future relations with the EU which was backed by the cabinet on Friday.He said he hoped his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist EU attempts to extract further concessions - but he insisted he was not seeking to undermine or challenge the prime minister. In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davis said Mr Raab would be \"very effective\" in the post. Reflecting on his resignation, he said he had lived with compromises in Brexit policy for two years but there came a point where these went \"too far\".\"I worry about the fine detail and that it will not work out as we hope,\" he said. Asked what he would say to colleagues who thought it was time to remove Theresa May, he replied it was \"not a good idea\" - insisting that she was a \"good prime minister\". Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker, who also resigned overnight, launched an attack on government policy. \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionEx-minister Steve Baker: \"We have all been blindsided by this policy\"\nHe told the BBC's Daily Politics that he had been \"blindsided\" by the Brexit proposal agreed at Chequers.Mr Baker also said that he and his team had been preparing a white paper \"which did not accord with what has been put to the cabinet at Chequers\".The mood at Westminster, by Iain WatsonThe atmosphere is volatile. The long-standing Leave supporters of the European Research Group of Tory MPs will have two meetings today - either side of the PM's address to her own MPs - to discuss next steps.Views differ on whether the government's position is simply impractical - \"the worst of both worlds\" - or whether it actually breaches a manifesto commitment by offering a customs union in all but name.But there is agreement amongst many Brexiteers that the policy should change, and quickly. It is less clear how they will bring that about. If there is not a direct triggering of a leadership contest, what are the options?One is that Brexiteers go \"on strike\" and refuse to back government policy in parliament, weakening her premiership unless she changes course.Another is that backbench Brexiteers put more pressure on like-minded cabinet colleagues to follow David Davis out the door.Speaking to the BBC last week, Mr Raab said the process of negotiating Brexit was \"rocky\" but what mattered was getting there in the end, which would require \"flexibility and pragmatism\". He told the Political Thinking podcast that he was \"relaxed\" about the UK leaving without a deal and it was \"not something I would fear\". Conservative MPs welcomed the appointment of Mr Raab, who has a black belt in karate, one describing him as a \"highly capable\" figure with a clear attention to detail. But Labour said a new man fronting the negotiations \"changed nothing\". \"The deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this government into crisis,\" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. \"It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy.\"\nDavid Davis - the maverick minister\nResignation letter and May's reply in full\nBrexit: Your guide to EU jargon\nAsked whether Mr Raab would be in charge of the talks, No 10 said Mrs May had \"always been, from the outset, the lead negotiator\". But a spokesman said there was a \"huge body of work to be done, in terms of preparations for the UK leaving the EU and that obviously includes no-deal preparations as well\". Mrs May will address Parliament later on the plan agreed at Chequers on Friday as well as address Tory MPs as she seeks to keep her Brexit strategy on track.Ahead of Monday's statement, opposition MPs and peers - as well as Tory MPs - are being offered briefings by Downing Street on the detail of the Chequers statement. A spokesman for the European Research Group of eurosceptic Tory MPs told the BBC that involving opposition MPs had caused considerable anger and was the government's \"stupidest mistake\". And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, likened a PM relying on opposition MPs to the children's story in which the gingerbread man accepts the offer of a ride across a river from a fox, only to get eaten by it.\n\n    \n        The best way to get news on the go\n        Download the BBC News App.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2N3vJgS","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503b97"},{"title":"Rare fluffy marsupials born in Australia","description":"For the first time in more than 50 years the marsupial is born in the wild on mainland Australia.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-09T08:48:43+01:00","category":"Australia","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The eastern quoll was driven to extinction on the Australian mainland by predators and disease\n                \n            \n            \n        A rare species of marsupial, the eastern quoll, has been born in the wild on the Australian mainland for the first time in more than 50 years.The native animals were once found along Australia's east coast until they were devastated by foxes and disease.Scientists in New South Wales (NSW) reintroduced the species from Tasmania earlier this year and now three females are carrying joeys in their pouches.The bean-sized babies will stay growing inside the pouches for three months.Nick Dexter, who works for the Booderee National Park where the species was reintroduced, said the development marked an important step.\n    \n        \n    \n\"There remains challenges ahead to establish a sustainable population, but to have thirty percent of the female quolls produce pouch young from this pilot project is a move in the right direction,\" he told AFP news agency.\"We've been tracking every animal in this project with a GPS collar and... we've been able to quickly discover and manage threats.\"\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Authorities released about 20 eastern quolls into Booderee National Park in March\n                \n            \n            \n        The eastern quoll is a furry carnivore that grows to be the size of a domestic cat.

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on 12 December after meeting police and receiving documents from them. Authorities say they were \"arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine state and security forces\" and that the information had been \"illegally acquired with the intention to share it with foreign media\".What do we know about the investigation?

The agency says it has pieced together what happened to them.According to Reuters, a group of Rohingya men seeking safety on a beach were singled out as their village was raided.Buddhist men from the village were then ordered to dig a grave and then the 10 men were killed, at least two hacked to death by the Buddhist villagers with the rest shot by the army.\nCould Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges?\nSeeing through the official story in Myanmar\nAfter the arrest of the two journalists the Burmese military carried out their own investigation into the incident. The investigation corroborated what the two journalists had found - that there had been an execution.However, the military described the 10 men as \"Bengali terrorists\" and said that they were executed because they could not be transported due to attacks on police stations by Rohingya militants.What does Myanmar's government say? The government in Myanmar (also called Burma) defends the military operation in Rakhine. On the incident at Inn Dinn, authorities published a full statement on the findings of their investigation into the killings.

A leadership contest now would be \"the wrong thing to do\", adding: \"I won't throw my hat into the ring.\"Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker has also resigned. He played a leading role in the Brexit campaign in the run up to the 2016 referendum. He was promoted to the Department for Exiting the EU as a parliamentary under-secretary in June last year.Conservative MP Peter Bone hailed Mr Davis's resignation as a \"principled and brave decision\", adding: \"The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.\"Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.\"\n    \n        \n            Skip Twitter post  by @jeremycorbyn\n            \n                David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows @Theresa_May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.

His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk.The move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Read Laura's full blog hereMrs May is due to address MPs on Monday afternoon and is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed by the cabinet at Chequers on Friday is the \"right Brexit\" for Britain.Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said it would be \"very difficult\" for Mrs May's plans to win the backing of MPs without Mr Davis.He told BBC 5 Live: \"These proposals will have to come to the House of Commons in legislation and the question is 'will they command support from Conservative MPs?'\"And I think without David Davis there, without his imprimatur, it will be very difficult for them to get the support of Conservative MPs and therefore the prime minister would be well advised to reconsider them.\"BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understands Mr Davis was \"furious\" after a meeting at No 10 earlier on Sunday and \"concluded he could not stay in post\".The resignation came as people awaited the verdicts of senior figures from the Brexit side of the 2016 referendum.  There has yet been no on the record comment from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, while Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC on Sunday he was urging Tory MPs to support Mrs May.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media caption'Be generous or we'll walk away' - Gove's warning to EU\nOne of the leading pro-Remain Conservative MPs Anna Soubry did not refer directly to Mr Davis's resignation, but tweeted it was \"not the time for egos, grandstanding and blind ideology\". The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the resignation was \"a blow\", adding that business had welcomed the agreement of ministers on Friday.Meanwhile, some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation was evidence of the need for a second referendum.Lord Adonis, a prominent backer of a second vote, tweeted: \"People's Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD's resignation. Now the Brexiteers holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn't a majority for any withdrawal treaty in Parliament.\"The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the proposed deal, adding: \"The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say\".Nigel Farage congratulated Mr Davis for quitting and called for Mrs May to be replaced as prime minister, accusing her of being \"duplicitous\" and claiming her response \"shows she is controlled by the civil service\".\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KEbXLU","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503b9d"},{"title":"Train delay due to 'drunk' station master","description":"Indian officials found him sleeping in his office with a few empty alcohol bottles under his cot.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-09T05:47:01+01:00","category":"India","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    India runs 11,000 trains every day, of which 7,000 are passenger trains\n                \n            \n            \n        Several trains were delayed in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh after the station master got drunk and fell asleep while on duty, officials said.Deep Singh did not respond to repeated calls from officials, causing them to rush to the Murshadpur train station.According to local media, Mr Singh was found sleeping in his office with empty alcohol bottles under his cot.Authorities said an inquiry had been ordered into the incident.They added that a medical examination showed a high level of alcohol in his blood.\n    \n        \n    \n\"He was dead drunk and could barely walk,\" a senior railway official is quoted as saying in The Hindu newspaper.

The Environmental Investigations Agency (EIA) found widespread use of CFC-11 in China, even though the chemical was fully banned back in 2010. Scientists have been extremely puzzled by the mysterious rise in emissions. But this report suggests the key source is China's home construction industry. Just two months ago, researchers published a study showing that the expected decline in the use of CFC-11 after it was completely banned eight years ago had slowed to a crawl. \n    \n        \n    \nThere were suspicions among researchers that new supplies were being made somewhere in East Asia. Rumours were rife as to the source. There was a concern among some experts that the chemical was being used to secretly enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons. The reality it seems is more about insulation than proliferation. \nElectric car points in all new homes planned\nExoskeletons promise superhuman powers\nCan we save the Lord of the Rings toad?\nCFC-11 makes a very efficient \"blowing agent\" for polyurethane foam, helping it to expand into rigid thermal insulation that's used in houses to cut energy bills and reduce carbon emissions. Researchers from the EIA, a green campaign group, contacted foam manufacturing factories in 10 different provinces across China. From their detailed discussions with executives in 18 companies, the investigators concluded that the chemical is used in the majority of the polyurethane insulation the firms produce. One seller of CFC-11 estimated that 70% of China's domestic sales used the illegal gas. The reason is quite simple - CFC-11 is better quality and much cheaper than the alternatives. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Barrels of chemicals seen by investigators in China which contain CFC-11\n                \n            \n            \n        The authorities have banned CFC-11 but enforcement of the regulation is poor. \"We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that companies very openly confirmed using CFC-11 while acknowledging it was illegal,\" Avipsa Mahapatra from EIA told BBC News. \"The fact that they were so blasé about it, the fact that they told us very openly how pervasive it is in the market, these were shocking findings for us.\" The EIA says that its estimates of the amount of the gas being used in China are in the middle of the emissions range calculated by scientists in their report in May.The scientist who first highlighted the problem with CFC-11 said the EIA findings seemed plausible, although it was difficult to be definitive.  Dr Stephen Montzka from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) told BBC News: \"The pervasiveness of the use of CFC-11 that seems apparent in China based on their survey is quite amazing, although it is hard for me to assess the accuracy of the emission estimate they make to know if it is indeed likely that this activity can explain all or most of what we are observing in the global atmosphere.\"So why is this important?This is a big deal because of the amount of the dodgy chemical being used and its potential to reverse the healing that's starting to take place in the ozone layer.China's polyurethane foam makes up about one-third of global production, so if they are predominantly using an ozone-depleting substance it will set back the closing of the ozone hole by a decade or more. As well as the ozone layer, CFC-11 has a warming impact. Researchers estimate that if the use of the chemical continues, it would be the equivalent of CO₂ from 16 coal-fired power stations every year!What can be done about this?As China is a signatory of the Montreal Protocol that governs the use of ozone-depleting substances, it should be possible to put trade sanctions in place. However, since the protocol was signed in 1987, this weapon of last resort has never been used and it's not expected in this case.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    A factory in China that told EIA that 99% of its products contained CFC-11\n                \n            \n            \n        What's more likely is that China will be encouraged to crack down on the production of CFC-11s and to launch a full-scale investigation with the support of the Montreal Protocol secretariat.  \"It is critical for the government of China not to treat these as isolated incidents,\" said Avipsa Mahapatra from the EIA. \"We want them to clamp down but it's supremely important for them to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the sector. It has to result in seizures, it has to result in arrests so that people know there are harsh penalties for the production of CFC-11.\"Delegates to the Montreal Protocol are meeting this week in Vienna and they will try to come up with a plan to tackle the issue. What is the ozone layer and why is it important?Ozone is formed in the stratosphere some 15 to 30km above the surface of the Earth by the interaction of solar ultraviolet radiation with oxygen in the air. In this location, the newly formed ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer and eye damage in humans, can damage crops and marine life. Remind me how the hole in ozone layer came about?Scientists discovered in 1985, much to their surprise, that there was a 30% drop in ozone levels over Antarctica in October of that year. By 1992, the hole was as large as North America. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Researcher capturing air samples from the ozone layer above the Arctic\n                \n            \n            \n        What was happening was that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons contained in refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, and aerosol propellants were releasing chlorine or bromine molecules when they were exposed to intense UV light in the stratosphere.  When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone, they destroy the molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created.So what did the world do about this?For once, the world acted speedily and to good effect. Most nations, including the chemical industry, signed up to the Montreal Protocol which quickly banned most of the worst-offending chemicals. Developing countries were given much longer to replace the gases. So while most of the richer countries got rid of CFC-11 in the mid-1990s, China and others were expected to completely get rid of it in 2010. That obviously hasn't happened just yet. I thought the ozone hole was recovering?Back in 2014 researchers reported the first signs of a thickening in the ozone layer. At that point they said it would take a decade for the hole to start to shrink but by September 2015 scientists found that the hole was approximately 4 million sq km smaller than it was in the year 2000 - that's an area the size of India.  All this was due to the global phase out of CFCs. So it was a major surprise to ozone experts to find that the expected decline in these elements in the air had stalled. And now, according to the EIA, the reason behind the slowdown has been discovered  - and it's mainly down to Chinese builders!\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KKeap2","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503ba0"},{"title":"The people who refused to let 16,000 trees die","description":"How a determined group of Indians stopped a project that planned to cut thousands of trees in Delhi.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-09T00:52:19+01:00","category":"India","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    In one such protest, Delhi residents hugged trees that were to be cut\n                \n            \n            \n        A citizen-led movement in India's capital Delhi has successfully halted the cutting of more than 16,000 trees in the city.

The one mitigating factor is that large parts of the city still have substantial green cover, although this has also been depleting due to development projects. \nDelhi's air pollution is triggering a health crisis\nWhy isn't Delhi on pollution red alert?\nCan Delhi ever clean up its foul air?\nThe latest plan to cut thousands of trees across seven Delhi neighbourhoods had actually been approved in July 2016. But the news only became public in June 2018 after media reports highlighted that about 11,000 trees were due to be felled in a single neighbourhood.\n    \n        \n    \nAlmost overnight, hundreds of residents, including environmental and anti-pollution organizations, formed a collective to fight against it.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Several Delhi residents participated in candle-light vigils to protest against the cutting of trees\n                \n            \n            \n        Activists began mobilizing opinion and people. The movement gained traction on social media and messaging apps like WhatsApp, inspiring more than 1,000 people to protest in various ways.These ranged from sit-ins to tree-climbing workshops, candle-light vigils, meditation protests, tree plantation activities and all-day patrolling efforts to keep a watch on the trees. For Delhi-based environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, this movement became a key part of his \"green activism\". Mr Jha is the founder of Swecchha, a non-profit organization that works on environmental and youth issues, and he has consistently led and participated in activities to make Delhi more \"liveable\". As someone who has planted thousands of trees across Delhi over the years, he felt that the government's plan violated citizens' right to clean air.\"The government is the custodian of citizens' rights and the environment,\" he said, adding that instead of taking steps to \"take us out of this environmental hazard\", the government was only making it worse.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The trees were proposed to be a cut for a government redevelopment project in Delhi\n                \n            \n            \n        Verhaen Khanna, an environmentalist who started a social media collective called the New Delhi Nature Society, agreed.\"None of the existing trees should be cut as they're living ecosystems within themselves,\" he said.Over the past few years, Mr Khanna has been trying to cure \"tree blindness\", a \"disease\" which he says is prominent in big cities - that people have no idea about the natural beauty around them. He regularly leads workshops and activities related to climbing trees, meditating under them, walking barefoot on grass plains and trekking across Delhi's lesser-known forested areas. \"It's a really devastating thing to happen to everybody in this city of almost 20 million people. Losing so many trees is catastrophic,\" he added.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Children are among the worst affected by air pollution\n                \n            \n            \n        Taken by surprise at the vehemence of public reaction, India's federal government retaliated. First they said that \"only 14,000 trees were to be cut\". They then promised to plant 10 saplings for every tree that is cut under what they called measures for \"compensatory afforestation\".  Ms Saklani called the announcement \"an incredible hogwash\", pointing out that the survival rate for saplings in India is \"dismal\".\"Also, how does it help if the saplings are planted 30km away from these neighbourhoods?\"Mr Khanna also dismissed the government's justification and reparation plans.\"They don't realize half a century or a full century is gone in creating those organisms using the country's natural resources,\" he said.Then on 28 June, the country's housing and urban affairs minister tweeted that \"no trees will henceforth be cut in the process of redevelopment of Delhi colonies\".\n    \n        \n            Skip Twitter post  by @HardeepSPuri\n            \n                I have always maintained that the green cover in Delhi will not be damaged & steps will be taken to enhance it even further.

A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was.The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials.\n            \n            \n        'Daring to believe'By Martin Patience, Chiang RaiOutside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence.Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan.A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday.Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama.It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys.The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive.\n            \n            \n        How are the boys being moved?A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionChild psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\nGetting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. \nThe operation in pictures \n'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'\nLetters of love from trapped Thai boys\nThe process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. \n            \n            \n        The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n            \n            \n        In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday.

Nearly two hours later, he disappeared suddenly over the English Channel. Did he simply crash or was he shot down? Emma Jane Kirby has been scouring the archives to find out. I've known for some time that 23-year-old Sgt Paul Meyer called his wife from the cockpit of his stolen Hercules aircraft - Jane Goodson, as she's now called, told me this herself when she spoke to me from her home in Virginia. \"Honey!\" he had told her triumphantly, waking her from a deep sleep. \"I got a bird in the sky and I'm coming home!\"What I didn't realise then, however, was that the last 20 minutes or so of their conversation was recorded. And when the transcript of that recording was sent to me, I will admit that I sat down and wept. By the time the tape recorder was rolling, Meyer's jubilation and bravado had left him. The cold reality of what he'd just done - and what lay ahead - had hit him squarely.\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThe last conversation between the homesick mechanic and his wife, read by actors - from PM on BBC Radio 4\n\"Well, honey I'll be really honest with you,\" he admits. \"I kind of think I made a big dang wrong mistake here. I feel like the biggest dodo around here right now. Over.\"Jane, clearly petrified, has to still her own nerves as she tries to reassure her panicking husband.\"You are the most wonderful thing in this whole world, you hear?\" she says. \"Honey, I'm going to bring you home, I'm going to fly you right in here, OK? Over.\"\n            \n            \n        Then Meyer's commanding officer tries to cut across the line. \"Sgt Meyer! Sgt Meyer! This is Col Kingery, do you read me?\" he says. \"It's Col Kingery from Mildenhall. Over!\"Alone in the 37-tonne, four-engine transport plane he was not qualified to fly, Meyer - unsure of his direction and unsure of what he was doing - tells his wife desperately: \"Everything will be all worth it if I can just kiss your sweet lips one more time. Over.\"And Jane, his wife of just 55 days, promises him: \"You'll get to kiss my sweet lips until we are old and grey in the rocking chairs in Missouri. Over.\"\n            \n            \n        Twenty minutes later, after Meyer has switched the plane to autopilot, the call cuts off. Meyer's final recorded words are: \"I'm doing all right, I'm doing all right, uh.\"Although he'd passed the USAF's \"human reliability test\" comfortably in the weeks before being posted to the UK, it's clear that Meyer had not been \"doing all right\" for some time. A Vietnam veteran, he'd been suffering from flashbacks and nightmares and - homesick and unhappy - he was reportedly drinking heavily.  In 1969, Sgt Ralph Howard Vincent, known by the nickname Sgt Mac, was serving in the 48th Air Police squadron at RAF Lakenheath, a few miles from Meyer's Mildenhall base. The first time he met Paul Meyer in a Suffolk pub, he thinks, Meyer had passed out from the amount of drink he'd consumed. He remembers banging a table to ask Meyer if he and his friends could share it with him, and Meyer, slumped across it, failed to stir.  It was only when the others bought a round that Meyer lifted his head, pushed his empty pint glass towards them and said: \"I'll let you sit here if you buy me a drink!\" \n            \n            \n        Sgt Mac spent two long evenings in the pub with Meyer and distinctly recalls Meyer ranting against the USAF, which he said was forcing him to work long hours away from his beloved family. He talked a lot, says Sgt Mac, about his \"beautiful wife\" and \"wonderful step-children\" and advised Sgt Mac to settle down and get married too, even though he was only 21. He also offered him some recipes for cooking squirrel.  But it was a conversation about flying that really struck Sgt Mac.\"Paul came up with a proposition,\" he explains. \"He said he wanted to get a private pilot's licence so he could fly home on leave… and he wanted to split the cost 50:50 with me… Looking back, I don't think he just got in that plane and took off. I think this was long-planned.\"Sgt Mac took a liking to Meyer and made plans to meet him again in the pub. But a few days later, just before breakfast, he remembers hearing a loud roar and his barracks at RAF Lakenheath shaking. He didn't know it then but it was Meyer who'd taken off in the stolen Hercules, on his way home.In his beautiful Cambridge garden, Vic Blickem shakes his head as he remembers that day. Back then Blickem worked for the USAF at Mildenhall in the casualty assistance office and it was his job to write to his superiors to tell them what had happened, so they could co-ordinate assistance to Meyer's family.  He remembers struggling to fill in the paperwork.\n            \n            \n        \"We were totally flummoxed - we didn't know if we should write Missing, Awol, Deserter, or what,\" he tells me.  \"So we came up with some form of words or other to get by… We wrote messages, I guess, for a couple of days then we were told not to send any more, and not to ask for updates and we were just shut down.  We were shut out. I asked my section commander if he thought Meyer was shot down and he said: 'Well, of course.'\"The US Air Force still has a presence at RAF Mildenhall - it's now home to the 100th Refuelling Wing. \"See that older building there?\" asks Dr Robert Mackey, the USAF wing historian, as we wander around the huge base with its lawns shrivelled by the searing summer heat. \"That's where Meyer would have eaten his meals.\" We head towards the shade of a large tree, watching a Hercules thunder overhead. I ask Mackey how the USAF views the Meyer incident today.\"It was a series of bad decisions by people who should have known better,\" he says firmly. \"And now we have systems in place to stop this kind of thing from ever happening again.\" The facts that Meyer had just come back from Vietnam and was newly married were major stress factors. \"The Air Force may not have done what it needed to do to take care of a guy who was clearly in crisis.\"Mackey can't pinpoint exactly the location of hard stand 21, from which Meyer taxied up the runway - the base has greatly changed over time and even the control tower is in its third reincarnation since 1969.  A young bare-chested airman walks past us in shorts, eating ice cream.  \n            \n            \n        \"It was a different time,\" Mackey says. \"Put yourself in the position of those guys - it was 1969, not 1999 - it was the Cold War and you never knew what was going on. Was he stealing the plane? Deserting? Going to East Germany? No-one knew. The system reacted - albeit slower than it could have been. It was a sad incident that resulted in a guy getting killed at the end.\" So did the system react by shooting him down? \"No!\" retorts Mackey. \"No. You've read the transcripts I've read and that is not what happened.\" But the transcript of the Mildenhall control tower's conversations with the squadron leader, Col Kingery, various radar posts and the USAF's Central Security Control, don't quite tally with the sparse account in the official USAF official Accident Report (all obtained by Sgt Mac through a freedom of information request, along with the transcript of the conversation between Meyer and his wife).The accident report claims that only two aircraft - a Hercules from RAF Mildenhall and an F-100 from RAF Lakenheath - were launched to try to find Meyer. Neither visual nor radio contact was established by either aircraft and they both simply returned to base. But the control tower transcript proves that a number of other aircraft took off to intercept Meyer's Hercules. At some point during the search, a British official is recorded telling Col Kingery: \"It looks like the French will be sending some fighters up now. This (position) will take him down into the French air which we couldn't really go down into.\" \n            \n            \n        And it wasn't just the French who scrambled fighters. In 1969, the east coast of England was peppered with Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) bases ready to respond to Russian threats. At RAF Wattisham, Peter Nash was a senior aircraftsman with 29 Squadron  and he distinctly remembers preparing three Lightning fighter aircraft to scramble. \"A klaxon went off, set off by the aircrew,\" he recalls. \"So we rushed out and got the aircraft ready, the pilots strapped in and quite soon Q1, the primary aircraft, was ordered to scramble. We knew something serious was going up.\" Nash shows me photographs of the QRA hangar at Wattisham. He tells me that two of the three aircraft he helped prepare took off, loaded with missiles.  \"It was later that morning we heard a USAF guy had stolen an aircraft from Mildenhall,\" he continues. \"And obviously it was our duty as the nearest QRA base to investigate unknown aircraft, so ours were sent to find him, shadow him and, if necessary, to shoot him down.\"\n            \n            \n        There is an account of that Wattisham operation in a 2011 book called The Lightning Boys. In it, former RAF pilot Rick Groombridge details how an American exchange pilot took over his aircraft at Wattisham to take part in the Meyer mission and was rumoured to have returned to base minus a missile. Groombridge declined to be interviewed but stands by his story.  Nash, however, is adamant that both planes returned to base with all four missiles intact - he should know, he explains, as he was the chief armourer and was responsible for inspecting the weapons and removing the firing plugs. A few weeks after the incident, Nash was sent on a course where he met a fellow armourer from RAF Chivenor in Devon, who told him that at least one Hawker Hunter was scrambled from his base. Allegedly, the Hunter pilot had returned to Chivenor minus missiles and was met by the RAF police and taken away for a secret debrief along with his plane's camera gun.  Nash says he keeps an open mind about the accuracy of the story but observes that Chivenor, being about 150 miles from where Meyer's Hercules went down in the Channel, was about 35 minutes flying time away for a Hunter.\"In other words,\" Nash says thoughtfully, \"it was well within capability.\" \n            \n            \n        In the Channel's busy shipping lanes, dive boat operator Grahame Knott continues to, as he puts it, \"mow the lawn\", searching for wreckage of Meyer's Hercules with Deeper Dorset, a team of divers. He's now scoured eight sq miles of seabed, examining targets with a side scanner and using remote cameras to pick up more detail on anything that looks particularly interesting. He's yet to spot anything, although there have been many false alarms. The next step will be to send down divers to look at specific targets. It's painstaking work - getting to this stage has taken 10 years of planning.  \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    A wreck detected on the seabed by Grahame Knott\n                \n            \n            \n        \"Why do I do it?\" Knott wonders aloud. \"Honestly, I ask myself that all the time and I just keep coming back to the image of young Meyer up there in that plane, completely alone and I guess I'm just doing it for him. He was just a kid, you know?\" he says. \"Just a homesick kid.\"When I first interviewed Meyer's stepson, Henry Ayer, a few months back, he warned me, very gently, to be careful because this story would suck me in. He was just seven when \"Daddy Paul\" died and he's spent most of his adult life trying to get more information about what caused him to crash. Worn down by conspiracy theories, by conflicting accounts and hearsay, he now just wants to bring Daddy Paul's body home to Virginia. The official line is that Meyer's body was never found. Yet eight weeks after Meyer's plane crashed into the Channel, two unidentified bodies washed up in Jersey. Detailed contemporary accounts from the Jersey Evening Post tell us that there was great excitement about a male corpse, thought to be aged around 25, found at La Saline Bay, St John's, by a rod fisherman. A subsequent inquest on the body concluded the young man had probably died from drowning. He was never identified although his teeth, which showed dental work of \"the British type\", were apparently not a match with Meyer's. He was buried in a pauper's grave on the island.  \n            \n            \n        But the newspaper also carried reports about another unidentified body.  On 17 July 1969, a launch, the Duchess of Normandy, was sailing back from Carteret in France with several dignitaries on board, when the skipper, Doug Park, spotted a badly decomposed, headless body floating in the water. He wanted to bring the body aboard but was asked not to because of the poor state the corpse was in.  His great friend, Ian Moignard, remembers Park's anger - and he also remembers Park describing the body.\"Doug Park told me it was in some sort of uniform… I think some kind of boiler suit. I do remember he said he'd written down some markings that were on the uniform - I presume he meant a service number on the lapel. But unfortunately the records at the harbour office have been destroyed or just can't be found.\" The official USAF accident report tells us that Meyer had been dressed in plain clothes the previous evening at a house party - he'd borrowed a friend's trousers for the occasion - but just before he stole the plane, the report says, Meyer had changed into flight gear.Park told Moignard that he'd tied the uniformed body to a buoy and alerted the authorities. But by the time the authorities got there it had become detached and floated away. The next day, the crew of a pleasure yacht, the Tien-Ho, also spotted the headless corpse but because there were very young children present, the skipper felt unable to haul it aboard.  Those children, now long grown up, are currently searching for Tien-Ho's missing log book, in the hope their parents might have written down more details.  So the body floated free and Meyer's family was never told about the sighting. The official telegram Meyer's widow Jane received from Washington, DC three weeks after Meyer disappeared is truly extraordinary. \"It is with deep regret,\" reads the document, \"that I learned of the death of your son.\"  The word \"son\" has then been crossed out and the word \"husband\" penned above it. \"Overseas Commander has advised me,\" continues the telegram, \"that remains of your son have not been recovered.\"\n            \n            \n        I show it to Vic Blickem as we sip coffee in his sunny garden.He puts his head in his hands. \"That's just terrible, it's just terrible,\" he says. \"It's either so casual they don't care or so incompetent they are negligent. But how terrible for the family.\"He laughs self-consciously. \"You know, we all hoped he'd make it,\" he says. \"We wanted him to make it, to get home and to live happily ever after - we even looked at maps to study islands south of England where we thought he might be able to land.\"Sgt Paul Meyer's wife, Jane, hoped against hope for that fairy-tale ending too. The cockpit radio transcript tells us she had put the hot water on, all ready for him when he walked through the door.  But the narrative didn't take the course she'd prayed for and it was the USAF chaplain who knocked on the door instead. Once upon a time there was a young, troubled war veteran who just wanted to go home. We are still working on the end of the story.

Mr Favreto had said the politician should be freed from jail while he appeals a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering.\"With all due respect, [Mr Favreto] has absolutely no qualified authority to override the decision,\" responded Federal Judge Sergio Moro, who has been the driving force behind Operation Car Wash.He told police to wait for clarification on the legal impasse.Judge Joao Pedro Gerbran Neto then overruled the decision, ordering police and jail authorities not to take any action. Mr Faverto then raised his order for the third time, but the one-hour deadline he imposed on police passed without any move being made to free the ex-president. The head of the court's intervention means that Lula will remain in prison.\nRead more about Lula \nA quick guide to Brazil's scandals\nA polarising figure Lula, who led the country from January 2003 to December 2010, is a divisive figure. Thousands of people took to the streets earlier this year to call for his immediate imprisonment, while his supporters also turned out in large numbers to insist he should be freed. His jailing was controversial as defendants in Brazil were previously allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted.However, the Supreme Court sided with a 2016 ruling from a lower court, under which defendants could be sent to jail after a failed first appeal.Could he return as president? Polls conducted before Lula was jailed in April suggested he was the frontrunner for October's presidential elections.Many political analysts say he will be disqualified from standing again because of his criminal conviction.  But this did not stop his supporters launching a campaign with an event last month.Judge Faverto cited this as a reason for him to be released, saying it counted as a new development and all candidates should be free in order to protect \"the democratic process\".However, others disputed this, saying Lula's intention to run was long known and nothing had changed to provoke a sudden change in his status.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Lula's supporters held an event in June to launch his pre-nomination campaign\n                \n            \n            \n        The electoral court will make an official decision in August on whether Lula can run. Why was he jailed?In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms.He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; £790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS.The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption.Lula lost his first appeal in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction but increased the sentence from nine-and-a-half years to 12. \n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2KGpClQ","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503ba5"},{"title":"Four Thai boys rescued but rest must wait","description":"The mission to save the football team trapped in a cave is paused after a \"smooth\" first phase.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-08T18:25:59+01:00","category":"Asia","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThere were cheers and applause as the first boys' rescue was confirmed\nThe operation to free 12 boys and their coach trapped in a cave in northern Thailand is running \"smoothly\", the head of the operation says.Four boys have been brought above ground so far in good health, rescuers say.The mission has now been paused for at least 10 hours as air tanks need to be replaced.Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation on Sunday because of fears of rising waters.The next phase would begin on Monday morning, after relaying \"all of the air tanks and all systems along the way\", Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said.\n    \n        \n    \nHe corrected earlier reports that said six boys had been freed.\nSunday's events as they happened\nHow risky is the Thai boys rescue?\nDivers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. They have reportedly been able to make the last part of the journey on foot.Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain to launch the mission much earlier than originally expected. The first phase has also been conducted much faster than officials had predicted.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionChild psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\nThe group and their families had all given their agreement that they should be moved as soon as possible, said Mr Narongsak.What is happening at the cave?A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    An ambulance arrives at a nearby hospital after leaving the cave site\n                \n            \n            \n        Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply.\n            \n            \n        The toughest section is about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n            \n            \n        In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would \"not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste\".\n            \n            \n        Sense of remaining uneaseBBC's Nick Beake at the sceneThis is a hugely high-profile rescue attempt and Thailand knows the world is watching. It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive.It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families.But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex.As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job. \n            \n            \n        Who are the boys and their coach?\n\nChanin Vibulrungruang, 11 (Nickname: Titan) - started playing football aged seven\n\nPanumas Sangdee, 13 (Nickname: Mig), wrote to his parents: \"The Navy Seals are taking good care of me\"\n\nDuganpet Promtep, 13 (Nickname: Dom) - captain of the Wild Boars, reportedly scouted by several Thai professional clubs\n\nSomepong Jaiwong, 13 (nickname: Pong) - reportedly dreams of playing for the Thai national team\n\nMongkol Booneiam, 13 (nickname: Mark) - described by his teacher as a \"very respectful and good child\"\n\nNattawut Takamrong, 14 (nickname: Tern) - told his parents not to worry about him\n\nEkarat Wongsukchan, 14 (nickname: Bew) - promised his mother he would help her at the shop once he was rescued\n\nAdul Sam-on, 14 - member of a volleyball team that came second in the North Thailand-wide tournament\n\nPrajak Sutham, 15 (nickname: Note) - described by family friends as a \"smart, quiet guy\"\n\nPipat Pho, 15 (nickname: Nick) - wrote in his letter he wanted his parents to take him for barbecued food once rescued\n\nPornchai Kamluang, 16 (nickname: Tee) - told his parents \"don't worry, I'm very happy\"\n\nPeerapat Sompiangjai, 17 (nickname: Night) - it was his birthday the day the boys went missing, and his parents have told him they are still waiting to hold his birthday party\nAssistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (nickname Ake), 25 - apologised in his letter to the parents, but they replied that they did not blame him\n\n            \n            \n        How did the group get there?The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach.It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths.Race against the rainOfficials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - and that could have meant months underground.They had also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in.But with the rainy season just beginning, it has become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionThailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers\nRescuers have been desperately pumping water out of the cave, and Mr Narongsak said on Sunday that water levels inside were at their lowest levels so far.\"There is no other day that we are more ready than today,\" he said.\n\n    \n        The best way to get news on the go\n        Download the BBC News App.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44757804","_id":"5b4851a8482c4afec5503baa"},{"title":"Japan flood crisis 'unprecedented'","description":"Officials warn of \"extreme danger\" as rains that have caused deadly floods are expected to continue.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-08T09:12:18+01:00","category":"Asia","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionJapan's military have been airlifting people to safety from the flood waters\nParts of western Japan hit by deadly floods and landslides are facing unprecedented danger as more downpours are expected, officials warn.\"We've never experienced this kind of rain before,\" a weather official said.More than 60 people are dead and dozens missing after record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks in Hiroshima and other areas.Two million people have been ordered to evacuate.

They are determined and focused\". The group and their families had all given their agreement that they should be moved as soon as possible, he said.'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'Why are they acting now?Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - that could have meant months underground.They'd also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    At a church in Chiang Rai, local people spent Sunday morning praying for the trapped boys\n                \n            \n            \n        But with the rainy season just beginning, it's become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days.Rescuers have been desperately pumping water out of the cave, and Mr Narongsak said on Sunday that water levels inside were at their lowest levels so far. \"There is no other day that we are more ready than today,\" said Mr Narongsak. \"Otherwise we will lose the opportunity.\"How will they bring them out?Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting 11-hour round trip even for the experienced divers.When the operation began, officials said the earliest the boys were likely to reach the surface was 21:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Sunday. One official has said it could take two to three days to get them all out. \n            \n            \n        They'll have to do a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving - all in complete darkness - along guide ropes already in place.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy will be accompanied by two divers who will also carry their air supply.\n            \n            \n        The toughest section is about halfway out - they'll reach section called \"T-Junction\", which is so tight the divers will have to take off their air tanks to get through. Eventually they'll reach Chamber 3, the cavern which has been turned into a forward base for the divers. They'll rest there before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They're expecting to be taken straight to hospital in Chiang Rai town.An expert's view on the dangers aheadIn an indication of quite how dangerous the journey will be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves earlier this week.

Earlier on, the mood around the rescue sites had been upbeat once the boys were found alive. Smiling volunteers would hand out snacks, or offer massages, to those on the site.Now security to the site has been beefed up even more. Several police vans, military officers and ambulances have been entering and exiting the site. There's a solemn sense of anticipation in the air.

Asylum seekers and economic migrants are flocking to the United States.Xenophobes warn these foreigners will fuel crime, drive down wages and destroy the nation.As nativism spreads like a prairie fire, an anti-immigrant president from New York rises to power. He has a proclivity for conspiracy theories and appoints his daughter to a key White House role.But the year isn't 2016.\n    \n        \n    \nIt's 1850.It's not Donald Trump.It's Millard Fillmore, whose sheer anonymity has made him an in-joke among presidential history fans.Instead of Muslim or Central American refugees, it's Germans and Irish Catholics.\nWho was Trump's nuclear Uncle John?\nWhat Trump has in common with Lincoln and Ferris Bueller\nThe effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town\nMr Trump prefers to liken himself to Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president.And there are similarities between the two.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Fillmore launched his career on the back of a conspiracy theory\n                \n            \n            \n        Both were populist outsiders who were dismissed as unfit to govern by an out-of-touch Washington elite.However, Jackson was a Democrat and a war hero who defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans.It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs.The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling.Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers.Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Millard was initially vice-president to Zachary Taylor (L)\n                \n            \n            \n        Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World. Democrats embraced these predominantly Catholic huddled masses as a new voting bloc.But as his biographer Robert Rayback writes, Fillmore shared the fear of some other top Whigs that the incoming papist hordes would plot to subvert America's sovereignty. When Millard lost his race for New York governor in 1844, he blamed \"foreign Catholics\".Immigrant voters were \"corrupting the ballot box - that great palladium of our liberty - into an unmeaning mockery\", he fumed.Compare this with Mr Trump's unfounded claim that millions of illegal immigrants cast votes in the last White House election.There's also a familiar ring to Fillmore's gripe about American jobs being taken by \"men of foreign birth to the exclusion of the native born\". Millard became vice-president to Zachary Taylor in 1849 and, following Old Rough and Ready's untimely demise a year later, an accidental president.Fillmore biographer Paul Finkelman, who is president of Gratz College in Greater Philadelphia, says: \"When Fillmore comes into office, the first thing he does is to literally fire his whole cabinet. \"Donald Trump has had more cabinet turnover than any other president probably since Millard Fillmore.\"The Fillmore administration was in constant turmoil because you didn't know who was running things from one day to the next, and that's precisely the same situation with Trump. It's government by chaos.\"Millard's daughter, Abby, became White House hostess, a position as high-profile as Ivanka Trump's. First Lady Abigail Fillmore was an introvert who largely shunned social functions - not dissimilar to Melania Trump.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Abigail Powers Fillmore and Melania Trump\n                \n            \n            \n        This president's undoing was his support for the Compromise of 1850, a pact between slave states and free states that was a signpost to the US Civil War. His stance on the toxic debate angered African-Americans.Dr Finkelman's biography notes that one Ohio preacher said: \"Would not the devil do well to rent out hell and move to the United States and rival if possible, President Fillmore and his political followers?\"Many black leaders and their allies today sound no less scathing of Mr Trump.In a humiliating snub, Fillmore was denied his party's nomination in 1852. He quit the Whigs to lead the virulently anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party.Dubbed the Know Nothings, they openly fomented ethnic and racial bigotry, culminating in 1855 with Bloody Monday, when Protestant mobs attacked German and Irish neighbourhoods in Louisville, Kentucky, leaving at least 22 people dead.At the elections a year later, the American Party carried just one state: Maryland - ironic, considering it had been founded as a sanctuary colony for English Catholics. Politically, Fillmore was no more.More on US presidents\nShould Washington and Jefferson monuments come down?\nIs Trump the heir to Abraham Lincoln?\nWas James Buchanan really the worst president?\nThe Whigs never recovered from his presidency. And out of their ashes rose the Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln.Joan Cashin, professor of history at Ohio State University, points out there are differences between Trump and Fillmore, not least that the latter grew up in rural poverty and was regarded as a polite, bland politician.Trump was the playboy son of a real estate millionaire - Fillmore was an indentured child apprentice in a textile mill.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The early home of Fillmore in New Hope, Cayuga County, New York\n                \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Trump's childhood home in Queens, New York City\n                \n            \n            \n        But Prof Cashin draws a distinct link between mid-19th Century prejudices and today.\"The notion that native-born white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are supposed to be in charge,\" she says, \"that they decide who's allowed to come here, that's a parallel. \"Except for Native Americans, we're all immigrants to one degree or another in this country. \"I think it was Martin Luther King who said, 'we may have come here in different ships, but we're all in the same boat now.'\"A postscript: Millard was held to be strikingly good looking. Queen Victoria reputedly praised him as the handsomest man she had ever met. Some people see an uncanny resemblance between Fillmore and the actor Alec Baldwin. Baldwin, of course, plays Mr Trump on the comedy show Saturday Night Live.The 13th president has faded in popular memory to little more than a trivia question. His Know Nothings are a warning from the past. And it is decades since the Millard Fillmore Society was last heard of.According to research, barely 8% of US college students are even aware who he was. If Mr Trump finds himself on the wrong side of history, he could one day be cruelly forgotten, too.Given America's enduring disunity, a prayer once uttered by Fillmore still seems to resonate: \"May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.\"\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2MSkHL2","_id":"5b4851a9482c4afec5503bb1"},{"title":"Thousands take to streets for Pride parade","description":"About 30,000 people march through central London to mark the annual celebration.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews","pubDate":"2018-07-07T19:01:48+01:00","category":"London","keywords":"","contentText":"\n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The parade started off from Portland Place, central London\n                \n            \n            \n        Streets in central London were filled with thousands of people as they celebrated the Pride in London parade.The parade itself, which coincided with England's World Cup quarter-final in Russia, included about 30,000 people from 472 organisations.But up to one million other people are thought to have lined the streets to watch the event.It started out from Portland Place at 12:00 BST and finished in Whitehall at about 17:00.  \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    As ever Pride participants produced some imaginative costumes\n                \n            \n            \n        Organisers said they hoped \"all the rainbows... will work their magic and send good vibes over to Russia.\"\n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The streets of London were lined with thousands of spectators\n                \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The parade was full of Pride's rainbow colours\n                \n            \n            \n        \"It's quite poetic with Russia being so problematic as far as LGBT rights are concerned, there's a beautiful synergy there,\" co-chairwoman Alison Camps said.\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionLGBT+ hate crime on the rise in London\nMs Camps said the event was taking place at a time LGBT rights issues were more important than ever as the UK is \"falling down the rankings in terms of the best place to be LGBT.\"\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionStuart Feather and Andrew Lumsden took part in the first London Pride march in 1972\n\"There's a real danger in this country that people assume that the battle is over and that the job is done,\" she said.A recent survey by Pride in London found Britons care more about animal rights than LGBT rights.\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    People sport colourful sequined costumes during the parade\n                \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    There were shouts and cheers as the parade got under way\n                \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Pride said this year's parade was the most diverse\n                \n            \n            \n        \nWhy we need to celebrate being black and gay\nIn pictures: Pride through the years\n\n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    Up to one million people are thought to have lined the streets for this year's parade\n                \n            \n            \n        Mayor of London Sadiq Khan took part and said he was proud of London's diversity and inclusivity.\"We aren't just tolerant, we are respectful, we celebrate diversity and we embrace it as well.

What we're going to do is say what works for the UK, what's right for the United Kingdom?\"A day after she secured cabinet approval on a plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU, Mrs May said ministers were now expected to speak with collective responsibility.  \"Collective responsibility has returned... we are moving forward together,\" she told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.Tory Brexiteer and ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg previously told the BBC that when detail of the plan emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal.Mr Rees-Mogg, said that so far only the three page summary of the deal had been published, and he would have to wait to see the full 100-plus page document to decide whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a \"punishment Brexit\".Ready to talk\n    \n            \n            Media playback is unsupported on your device\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Media captionTheresa May: \"This is a serious, workable proposal\"\nMrs May will now have to take the plan to the EU, which she said was now ready to sit down and discuss the proposals. \"From the soundings I've had so far, there is a willingness to sit down and talk about this and a recognition that actually we now are in the stage where we need to agree what the future relationship's going to be,\" Mrs May said on Saturday.\"This is a serious, workable proposal,\" she added.The plans that ministers backed would see an end to freedom of movement. But a \"mobility framework\" would be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply to study and work.Mrs May said when people voted to leave the EU, \"they wanted to take control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will do\".The main details from the Chequers statement:\nThe UK would accept continuing \"harmonisation\" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade\nParliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so\nThere will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater \"regulatory flexibility\" and \"strong reciprocal arrangements\"\nFreedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a \"mobility framework\" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work\nA new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of \"a combined customs territory\"\nThe UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy\nThe jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules are in force \n\n            ","siteName":"bbcnews","link":"https://bbc.in/2zpd9hg","_id":"5b4851a9482c4afec5503bb3"}]
